    "answer": "The reaction is significantly slowed down with higher [PF6] -concentrations, which suggests that either the photooxidation of CH3CN or the cage escape reaction is slower at high ionic strength.",
    "context": "To confirm that neither dissociated dgpy ligand nor the [PF6] -counter ions are potentially reacting with this LMCT state we performed several test reactions. Partial ligand dissociation and consequently the presence of traces of dgpy in the solution as potential substrate could be excluded as [Mn(dgpy)2] 4+ would oxidize uncoordinated dgpy already in its ground state in the dark (Supplementary Fig. ). F and P NMR spectroscopy before and after photolysis confirm that the [PF6] -counter ions are not photooxidized as the NMR spectra remain unchanged after photolysis (Supplementary Figs. 34, 35). To further support the redox innocence of the [PF6] -counter ions, the perchlorate salt [Mn(dgpy)2][ClO4]4 has been prepared and investigated additionally (Supplementary Information). Irradiation of [Mn(dgpy)2][ClO4]4 at 730 nm in CH3CN leads to photoreduction of [Mn(dgpy)2] 4+ as well, even slightly faster than with [PF6] -counter ions (Supplementary Figs. 36, 37). The molar conductivity of [Mn(dgpy)2][PF6]4 in CH3CN is with 640 S cm -1 M -1 comparably high (Supplementary Fig. ), although not many 1:4 electrolytes have been investigated so far hampering comparisons. A molecular dynamics simulation of [Mn(dgpy)2][PF6]4 in CH3CN over 1 ¬µs resulted in shells of counterions with Mn ‚Ä¶ [PF6] (center-of-mass) distances peaking at 4.1, 6.1, 7.3 and 8.5 √Ö suggesting ion-pairing with [PF6] - ions (Supplementary Fig. ). Similarly, the molar conductivity of [Mn(dgpy)2][PF6]3 in CH3CN (560 S cm -1 M -1 ) is high for a 1:3 electrolyte (Supplementary Fig. ). To probe the effect of ion paring on the photoreduction and cage escape, [Mn(dgpy)2][PF6]4 was photolyzed in CH3CN in the presence of increasing amounts of [n-Bu4N][PF6] (0, 50, 100 and 200 mM; Supplementary Figs. ). The reaction is significantly slowed down with increasing [PF6] -concentration suggesting a slower photooxidation of CH3CN or a slower cage escape at high ionic strength (Supplementary Fig. ). As the ultrafast dynamics observed by TA spectroscopy are unaffected by the presence of 100 mM [n-Bu4N][PF6] (Supplementary Fig. ), we suggest that the initial static quenching is not hampered but rather the cage escape reaction at high ionic strength. A similar retarding effect on the photoreduction, likely also affecting the cage escape rate, occurs when diluting the acetonitrile solution with redox-inert orthodichlorobenzene in 1:1 and 1:2 v/v ratios (Supplementary Figs. 45-47).",

An 11% catalyst loading heteroleptic species [Pd2(E-1)2(2)2](BArF)4 converted 24% of the benzoyl nitromethane to the Michael addition product in 10 hours. Having already found that the homoleptic photoswitchable cage [Pd2(E-1)4](BArF)4 is not a catalyst (see above), we also tested whether [Pd3(2)6](BArF)6/[Pd4(2)8](BArF)8 would show any reactivity. These homoleptic species also showed virtually no catalysis, with <1% benzoyl nitromethane going to the product over 10 hours. To ensure [Pd2(E-1)2(2)2](BArF)4 was responsible for the catalysis, control experiments were performed using no catalyst and with [Pd(Py*)4](BArF)2.

Based on DFT calculations (r 2 SCAN-3C/CPCM (CH2Cl2)) Bobbitt's salt 30 itself (right inset, Figure ) appears to be in a stabilizing boat conformation with interaction between the amide and oxoammonium which differs from its solid-state structure.

Unfortunately, (-)-ester 34 gave a 1:3 ratio of (-)-2 and (-)-3 after mild saponification conditions.

A proposed, stabilized alcohol-Bobbitt's salt adduct has been reported by the Rutjes group. A DFT model (Figure ) showed that adduct (-)-43 is stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonding. We also conducted a showed the disappearance of the allylic hydroxyl signal of 1 after treatment with 30. In order to probe the selectivity for AKR of the enantiomers of substrate 2, we also conducted a computational study (r 2 SCAN-3C/CPCM (CH2Cl2)) for transition states of isobutyrylated hyper-BTM catalyst 45 with (-)-2 and (+)-2, respectively. A transition state model (TS-C) of 45 with (-)-2 clearly showed an n-to-cation interaction of the chromenone oxygen to 45 (distance 3.15 √Ö, Figure ) while the transition state model (TS-D) of 45 with (+)-2 has poor alignment due to steric hindrance. Only a ÔÅ∞-to-cation interaction of the alkene of (+)-2 to 45 is allowed in the latter transition state (distance 3.17 √Ö, Figure ).

    "context": "Turning to the equivalent BArF salt, we then tested whether the heteroleptic cage [Pd2(E-1)2( )2](BArF)4 could be formed, and in particular, whether it could be generated from the rearrangement of the two homoleptic structures. Homoleptic structures [Pd2(E-1)4](BArF)4 and [Pd3(2)6](BArF)6/[Pd4(2)8](BArF)8 can be assembled with [Pd(Py*)4](BArF)2 in CD3CN, and were characterized by NMR (SI S6.4, S9.4) and ESI-MS data (SI S6.5, S9.5). When a 1:1 mixture of these two homoleptic cages was combined in CD3CN and heated at 50 ¬∞C for 30 min, the heteroleptic cage was formed quantitatively (SI S10.5). This indicates that swapping from BF4 to BArF counteranions does not lead to problems of kinetic trapping. However, the solvent that is optimal for this catalysis-dichloromethane-is poorly coordinating and therefore does not promote the rapid ligand exchange required for cage switching. We found that a solvent mixture of 11:1 CD2Cl2/CD3CN, was a good compromise to maximize the host-guest chemistry while providing some coordinating properties to facilitate cage rearrangement (see SI S14, S15).",

    "context": "Next, we explored the scope of the isomerization using 1,4disubstituted cubanes under the optimized reaction conditions. Cubanes bearing two electron-withdrawing groups generally rearranged in high yields to the 2,6-isomer with modest to good selectivity. Reaction of 1-acid-4-methyl ester (1a), 1,4-dimethyl ester (1b), and 1-cyano-4-N,N-diisopropyl amide (1d) cubanes gave excellent selectivity for the 2,6-isomers 2a, 2b, and 2d, respectively, in good yields. Furthermore, the potentially-sensitive bromide group of 2e was also tolerated. However, 1,4-diamide (1c) and 1-amide-4-methylester (1g) cubanes underwent the rearrangement in good yield with poor regioselectivity. When cubanes bearing one electron-withdrawing and one electron-donating group were treated with AgTFA, single 1,3-isomers were produced in moderate to excellent yields. 1methylester-4-hydroxymethyl (1f) and 1,4-dihydroxymethyl (1h) cubanes underwent rearrangement in 99% and 96% yields, respectively, providing 1,3-cuneanes 3f and 3h. Cubanes possessing one electron-withdrawing group and the p-tolyl moiety on the opposite vertex were gratifyingly compatible with the reaction conditions, generating 3i-3k in 92-99% yields. Similarly, the rearrangement of a diaryl cubane (1l) took place efficiently in this reaction system to furnish 3l in quantitative yield. A heteroaryl substituted cubane was easily converted to the corresponding cuneane 3m obtained in 85% yield. Furthermore, this protocol was also compatible on a large scale; conducting the rearrangement with 5 mmol of 1a and 1f afforded the corresponding cuneanes 3a and 3f in 75% and 99% yields, respectively. Unfortunately, the rearrangement was unsuccessful with cubanes bearing -I, -Bpin, and -NHBoc groups, giving either almost no conversion or substrate decomposition to uncharacterized complex mixtures.

Beside the simple naphthalene substrate, aryl iodides in various fused structures, such as 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran (4c), dibenzofuran (4d), carbazole (4f), and pyrene (4g), could all give the desired products in good yield. In addition, monocyclic aryl iodides of different electronic properties, e.g., those with electron-donating and -withdrawing groups, also worked well (4h-4w). A wide range of FGs, including fluoro (4h), bromo (4k and 4t), chloro (4o), silyl ether (4l), nitrile (4n), free alcohol (4p), amide (4q), amine (4r), ester (4u) and cyclopropane (4v), were tolerated. Moreover, N-heteroarenebased substrates, such as quinoline (4x), isoquinoline (4y and 4z), and pyridine (4aa-4ac), can smoothly deliver the functionalized methyl ethers. Furthermore, late-stage modification of complex natural products and drugs (4ad-4ag) could be achieved with reasonably good efficiency indicating the generality of this method. Apart from orthosubstituted aryl iodides, para-and meta-substituted ones also reacted, albeit in moderate to low yield (Supplementary Information, Fig. ). The scope of the reagents for functionalizing the ipso position was examined next. Beside tert-butyl acrylate, different Michael acceptors, including methyl acrylate, 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethyl acrylate, and acrylonitrile (4ah-4aj), and styrene (4ak) can be coupled to install diverse alkenyl groups. In addition to the Heck quench, alkynylation and hydrogenation (4al, 4am) are also feasible for the ipso functionalization. Lastly, the deuterated methoxy group (4b) can be introduced in a similar manner with the deuterated electrophile (d-2a). Beyond methoxylation, the coupling with a bulkier alkoxy group appears to be more challenging at this stage due to the increased steric hindrance, though a promising preliminary result has been obtained for the ortho ethoxylation reaction (Supplementary Information, Fig. ). Compared to aryl iodides, aryl bromides are known to be more challenging substrates for the Catellani reactions despite their greater accessibility and lower cost. To our delight, the use of DPEphos as the ligand and KI as an additive (Supplementary Information Table ) allowed various aryl bromides to be competent substrates for the ortho methoxylation (Fig. ). Sensitive FGs, such as aldehyde (4ap), benzothiophene (4aq), benzofuran (4ar), highly strained ether (4as) and amine (4at), were tolerated.

These results indicate that the polar resonance form 4B (Chart 1) is the dominant contributor to the structures of 1-hydroxy-4,5-benzotropylium derivatives whereas 3A is more dominant contribution for the 4,5-benzotrones derivatives. The aromaticity of 4 was also assessed by DFT calculations. NICS(1) values of 1-hydroxy-4,5-benzotropylium with no substituents [i.e., 4 (R = H)] calculated at the GIAO-B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p)//ÔÅ∑B97XD/6-31G(d,p) level were -6.55 and -12.11 for rings A and B, respectively. The diatropicity of heptagonal ring A was significantly increased compared to the parent 4,5benzotropone (-1.06), as was reported for the corresponding tropone/hydroxytropylium system. The contribution of 4B was also supported by anisotropy of induced current density (AICD) calculations, in which a diatropic ring current originating from a 10ÔÅ∞ÔÄ†macrocyclic system was observed (Figure ). In contrast, the AICD plot for 3 (R = H) revealed that a strong diatropic ring current was observed only in the fused benzene ring (ring B), while the seven-membered ring possesses a more polyenic character (Figure ).",

For instance, while Pt@SiO2 particles measure 1.8 ¬± 1.0 nm and Fe@SiO2 particles measure 1.5 ¬± 0.2 nm, the bimetallic Pt1Fe1@SiO2 exhibits much smaller particles at 0.7 ¬± 0.2 nm.

    "context": "All materials are also characterized by HAADF-STEM that shows narrowly distributed nanoparticles, whose size depends on ÔÅ£Pt/Fe. While monometallic Pt@SiO2 and Fe@SiO2 present particles of 1.8 ¬± 1.0 nm and 1.5¬± 0.2 nm respectively, the combination of iron and platinum generally yields smaller nanoparticles (Table ). For instance, Pt1Fe1@SiO2 shows a PSD of 0.7 ¬± 0.2 nm, indicating a strong interaction between Pt and the Fe promoter. For sufficiently large particles, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) maps show that Pt and Fe profiles strongly overlap, suggesting the formation of Pt-Fe alloys upon H2 reduction (Figure S 37-38). The formation of an alloy is further corroborated by XAS (vide infra) and high-resolution TEM images with lattice spacings consistent with the formation of PtFe alloys, e.g. Pt2Fe1@SiO2 (0.21 nm) vs. Pt3Fe1 bulk-alloy (0.215 nm) and pure-FCC Pt (0.226 nm) (Figure S 39).

The occurrence of pressure dependent features at 2005 cm -1 and 2025 cm -1 hints towards the formation of a Fex(CO)y species, therefore indicating the presence of reduced iron.

    "question": "Which three components were shown to be indispensable for achieving the desired chemical transformation?",
    "answer": "The reaction requires a photocatalyst, zirconocene, and visible light because omitting any one of these components led to no product formation.",
    "context": "Interestingly, applying the reaction conditions previously established for the dechlorination (5.0 mol% Cp2Zr(OTs)2, 3.0 mol% Ir(4-MeOppy)3, 60 mol% 1,3-di(ptolyl)thiourea, 1,4-CHD (3.0 equiv), PhCF3, MS4√Ö, blue LEDs, 35 ¬∞C, 12 h) did not promote defluorination. This indicates that the defluorination requires a distinct set of conditions compared to dechlorination. However, after further optimization of these parameters, we identified effective reaction conditions for this transformation. Additional screening of photocatalysts and solvents also influenced the yield of 2a (see the Supporting Information for details). Control experiments in the absence of photocatalyst, zirconocene, or visible light irradiation resulted in no product (entries 8-10), highlighting the essential role of each component and the necessity of visible light. With the optimized reaction conditions, in hand, we next explored the substrate scope (Table ). Various afluoroacetic acid derivatives, including alkyl ester (1a), benzyl esters (1b-1e), benzyl amide (1f), and anilides (1g and 1h), were successfully defluorinated, affording to the corresponding hydrogenated products 2a-2h in moderate to good yields. Interestingly, the starting material to anilide 2g, monofluoromethyl compound 1g, is the product of a SET-based photoredox reaction that typically targets trifluoromethylated compounds. This observation highlights the complementary nature of the newly developed reaction compared to SET-based photoredox processes. Notably, defluorination occurred preferentially over the dehalogenation of bromoarenes (E1/2 = -2.2 V vs SCE) or chloroarenes (E1/2 = -2.6 V vs SCE), which are more susceptible to single-electron reduction. Additionally, benzyl fluoride (1i) and difluoroacetamide (1j), which possess weaker (97.6 kcal/mol) and similarly strong C-F bonds, respectively, compared to monofluoroacetate, were also successfully defluorinated. Secondary alkyl fluorides, including easily reducible substrates such as ketone (1k) and trifluoromethyl arene (1l), were To further explore the synthetic potential of this reaction, we then investigated the radical alkylation of monofluorides (Table ). After screening various conditions, we found that the combination of Ir(4t Buppy)3, ( n BuC5H4)2ZrCl2, TU1, and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (1,4-CHD), under visible light irradiation efficiently converted 1b and alkene 3 into the desired alkylated products 4. Gratifyingly, various terminal olefins containing different functional groups, such as alkyl (3a and 3b), silyl (3c), boronate (3d), and nitrile (3e) were all tolerated, yielding the corresponding alkylated products 4ba-4be in moderate to good yields. Additionally, the thioglycoside derivative (3f), aryl benzoate (3g), and benzamide (3h) react well without affecting these reactive functional groups. Notably, even an internal alkene (3i) was successfully alkylated. Furthermore, activated alkenes such as enol ethers (3j and 3k), enamine (3l), vinyl sulfide (3m), and indene (3n) afforded the corresponding alkylated products 4bi-4bn in moderate to good yields. Interestingly, when diphenyl ethylene (3o) was employed, unsaturated ester 4bo was obtained, likely via an oxidative radical-polar crossover followed by deprotonation. Furthermore, natural products and pharmaceutical compound, including safrole (3p), eugenol (3q), and alibendol (3r), were successfully applied in this transformation. Next, we examined the scope of fluorides using terminal alkene 3s. a-Fluoroacetates (1a and 1c) were applicable to yield the corresponding alkylated products 4as and 4cs in moderate yields. Amide (1f) and anilides (1g and 1h) were also tolerated under these conditions. Moreover, malonate (1n) was successfully alkylated, providing product 4ns. These results demonstrate the mild conditions of our catalytic system, which enables defluorinative alkylation to proceed efficiently with a broad range of functional groups, highlighting the versatility and unique radical reactivity of this methodology.",

    "answer": "UU-201 exhibits an uptake of approximately 4.00 mmol g‚Åª¬π and about 110 cm¬≥ cm‚Åª¬≥.",
    "context": "UU-201 showed the highest SF6 uptake at 1 bar, 293K, of ~4.00 mmol g -1 (~110 cm 3 cm -3 ), followed by UU-202 with ~3.28 mmol g -1 (~86.5 cm 3 cm -3 ), UU-203 with ~2.99 mmol g -1 (~31.2 cm 3 cm -3 ) and UU-204 with ~2.75 mmol g -1 (~56.2 cm 3 cm -3 ). The SF6 working capacities of the UU-MOFs could be represented by considering the gas uptakes at 0.1 and 1.0 bar, these values are listed in Table . The SF6 uptake off these four MOFs can be compared with a number of other microporous sorbents in Table , The mmol g -1 SF6 uptake of the UU-201 is comparable to those of Zn-MOF-74 (3.80 mmol g -1 at 298 K and 1 bar) , Co2-(1,4-bdc)2(dabco) (3.39 mmol g -1 at 298 K and 1 bar) , Zn4O(btb)2 (3.12 mmol g -1 at 298 K and 1 bar) , and MIL-100(Fe) (2.95 mmol g -1 at 298 K and 1 bar) . As the SF6 capacity of UU-201 is high, we also consider the vol./vol. gas uptake that could be relevant for real-life applications. The vol./vol. uptake of UU-201 (Table ), although not as high as Mg-MOF-74 (~158 cm 3 cm -3 at 1 bar), is higher than most other commonly discussed potential SF6 sorbents, such as Zn-MOF-74, Co-MOF-74, Co2(1,4-bdc)2(dabco), UiO-66(Zr), and zeolite 13X etc. The difference between the SF6 uptake on UU-201 and UU-202 was ~21 mol.% g -1 and between UU-203 and UU-204 was ~8 mol.% g -1 (higher than the expect 6 mol.% g -1 based on the difference in the metal alone). It was clear that the UU-201 and UU-202 structure had a higher overall SF6 uptake capacity than UU-203 and UU-204, although the SF6 uptake at low pressures was higher on UU-203 and UU-204. These observations could be explained with the following: 1) All four MOFs have pores with apertures ~7-9 √Ö, pores in this size-range were previously observed by us on mixed-linker ZIF-7-8 to be favorable for SF6 sorption. 2) The overall pore volume related to pores in the favorable size-range may be higher on UU-201 and UU-202 than on UU-203 and UU-204, which would explain the increased SF6 capacity on UU-201 and UU-202, 3) The pores on UU-203 and UU-204 may be overall smaller than those on UU-201 and UU-202, possibly arising from the size-difference between the TBAPy 4--and TCPB 4--linkers. These smaller pores (~7 √Ö, Figure , e.g. lozenge-shaped channels) are closer in size to the kinetic diameter of SF6 and have enhanced interaction with SF6 compared to the larger pores found on UU-201 and UU-202 (DFT-PSD peak at around 8.7-9 √Ö, i.e. hexagonal channels). This is apparent according to the SF6 adsorption isotherms of UU-203 and UU-204, where the isotherms showed a shape increase at the low-pressure range. a Measured at 293 K.",

The synthesis commenced with iodination of these two chiral compounds under Appel's conditions, resulting in the corresponding alkyl iodide on gram scale. In the initial attempts of nickel-catalyzed reductive cross-coupling between drimenyl iodide (S4) and aryl iodide (S5), diene (S6) was the dominant product due to Œ≤-H elimination (Table ). Fortunately, alkyl iodide (7) obtained from albicanol successfully produced coupled products 9 in moderate to good yields with various aryl halides using Weix's condition (Figure ).

    "context": "We further sought to exploit the ability of intercepting the diradicaloid o-QDMs by H-atom transfer (HAT) to synthesize tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloids and related bioactive molecules directly from simply arylaldimines (Table ). This class of alkaloid displays a wide range of biological properties, including as antineutroinflammatory and anticancer antibiotic activities. Our initial attempt to synthesize ticlopidine (Ticlid¬Æ) 21, a commercial medicine to prevent strokes, from an imine derived from 2-vinylthiophene-3-carbaldehyde and 2chlorobenzylamine led to benzylic thioetherification potentially due to reaction at the benzylic position with 4-FC6H4S‚Ä¢. We were able to address this issue and synthesize ticlopidine 21 by simply switching 4-FC6H4SH to its sterically encumbered variant, 2,4,6-triisopropylthiophenol, to prevent the radical recombination with ArS‚Ä¢. Moreover, we also utilized imines derived from 2-vinyl-4,5-dimethoxybenzaldimine with 3,4-dimethoxybenzylamine, 3,4-methylenedioxybenzylamine and 4-fluorobenzylamine, respectively, to prepare intebremine 22, intebrinine 23 and MAO-B-In-15 (a MAO-B inhibitor) 24. 25b, 29 Likewise, we were also able to convert an imine derived from 2-vinyl-4,5methylenedioxyphenylcarbaldehyde with 4-methoxybenzylamine to another alkaloid viguine 25. Table . Application of intercepting diradicaloid o-QDMs by HAT to synthesize dihydroisoquinoline alkaloids and related bioactive molecules a a Conditions: 0.50 mmol scale reaction in 3 mL solvent with 3 equiv of ArSH. b 4-FC6H4SH was used. In-situ generated imine was used directly without purification. After confirming the formation of azabicyclic o-QDMs and their diradical nature, we proceeded with conducting [4 + 2] cycloaddition reactions to intercept them in their 1,3-diene form. As such, when aldimine 1 was heated with N-phenylmaleimide at 130 ¬∞C in dioxane for 3 h, the [4 + 2] cycloaddition product 26 was produced in 95% yield (Table , entry 1) via the formation of two carbon-carbon (C-C) bonds across the dibenzylic 1-and 4-positions of the azabicyclic o-QDM (such as 18). The reaction can be readily scaled up to gram scale without loss in yields (14.48 mmol, 5.07g, 92%). The reaction can be conducted in toluene, DCE, MeOH and DMF in similar yields (69-82%) (entries 2-4). The reaction proceeded in moderate yields (38-43%) in other solvents like MeCN, DMA, NMP and DMSO (entry 5). The reaction could also be run without solvent (neat), at 100 ¬∞C, in 1 h or with 1 equiv of N-phenylphthalimide to obtain the product in good yields (entries 6-9). After establishing the optimal reaction parameters, we examined the scope of o-QDMs for [4 + 2] cycloaddition (Table ). The azacyclic o-QDMs could be intercepted with a range of cyclic dienophiles, such as maleic anhydride, maleimide, N-alkyl (methyl, t-butyl, cyclohexyl) maleimide and N-aryl maleimide (27-32) in high endo selectivity. The azacyclic o-QDMs also tolerate acidic protons as shown by the [4 + 2] cycloaddition with N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)maleimide (32). The o-QDMs were also reactive with acyclic symmetric dienophiles like trans-1,2-dibenzoylethylene (33). Unsymmetric dienophiles such as methyl vinyl ketone and methyl acrylate furnished the [4 + 2] cycloaddition products (34-35) as a mixture of endo and exo products in moderate selectivity. Next, we examined the scope with regard to different electronic and steric variations on 2-alkenylaldimines. The reaction tolerates both electron rich and deficient substituents, such as methyl, tert-butyl, methoxy, dimethoxy, 1,3-dioxanyl, fluoro, difluoro, trifluoromethyl and nitro, at different positions on the aldiminyl arenes (36-48). Likewise, the 2-alkene in 2-alkenylaldimine can also be varied with methyl, phenyl, ester and benzyl ether at the ÔÅ° and ÔÅ¢-positions (39-55), demonstrating that both disubstituted terminal (49-51) and internal (52-55) alkenes can participate in the reaction. More sterically hindered tri-and tetrasubstituted 2-alkenes bearing two and three methyls, carbocycles and N,O-heterocycles at both the ÔÅ°and ÔÅ¢-positions also undergo 6ÔÅ∞-electrocyclization followed by [4 +2] cycloaddition (56-61), showcasing the robustness of this method and high reactivity of azacyclic o-QDMs to create highly hindered bridged azabicyclic structures. The reaction also shows a high level of compatibility with substituted anilines on the imine. For example, imines derived from anilines substituted at ortho, meta and para-positions with methyl, methoxy, dimethoxy, thiomethyl, chloro, bromo, iodo and meta-dinitro groups, are excellent substrates for [4 + 2] cycloaddition (62-69). Imines derived from polyaromatic amines (70) and heteroaryl amines (71) are also compatible for the reaction. Reactions can also be conducted with 2-alkenylketimines derived from 2-alkenylacetophenone and 2-alkenylbenzophenone (72-73).

As coupling fragments with halides, heterocycle, ring-structured alkyl, benzyl, alkenyl, linear alkyl with or without arene replacements, and alkyl with or without heteroatoms were all tolerated. Delightfully, homobenzylic halides with different phenyl substitutes could be produced in moderate to good isolated yields from different sources (4-6, 14-16, 18-22). Electronic effects on benzene rings didn't show much impact on the process. A similar observation was found for benzylic radical fragments (1-3, 17). It is notable that even when active benzylic/allylic sites were accessible, no regioisomer was found besides the desired product (3-6, 8, 14-23, 27).",

This observation suggests that silver salts with non-coordinating counterion are more efficient for this transformation. Subsequently, various solvents like o-DCB, DCE, MeOH, CHCl3 and 1,4dioxane were screened; amongst which, the use of DCE provided an excellent yield of 98% (entry 9). Further, while screening other (P, N)-ligated gold complexes, it was found that MorDalPhosAuCl could also catalyse the reaction giving a 56% yield of the desired product (entry 11). 16 With the optimized reaction conditions in hand, we turned our attention to explore the scope of alkenyl iodides 1 by treat-ing it with O,O-diphenyl phosphorothioate 2a (Scheme 2).

Also, meta and ortho substituted styrenyl iodides reacted to deliver the products (3j-3m) in 48-84% yields. Notably, the styrenyl iodides bearing iodo, bromo and chloro substituents react in a chemoselective fashion to deliver the products (3d, 3f, 3g, 3k and 3m) in 48-87% yields. Next, naphthyl-based alkenyl iodides (1n and 1o) and disubstituted styrenyl iodides 1p and 1q coupled efficiently to give desired products (3n-3q) in 54-93% yields. Also, octenyl-derived alkenyl iodide 1r and ethyl-3-iodoacrylate 1s provided the corresponding products (3r and 3s) with high yields (75% and 91%, respectively). Certainly, the (Z)-isomer of 1s delivers the (Z)-isomer of product 3s selectively. Delightfully, estrone-derived alkenyl iodide 1t also worked well to afford the product 3t in 78% yield. Further, we sought to investigate the scope of phosphorothioates 2. Both O,Odiphenyl phosphorothioate 2a and O,O-dialkyl phosphorothioates (2u-2w) were found to react well with (2iodovinyl)benzene 1a to afford the desired products (3a, 3u-3w) in moderate to excellent yields (62-98%).

Using an alternative Ni-diketonate sorting catalyst, an array of primary substrates were paired with tertiary olefin-derived radicals to efficiently access diverse quaternary products (see SI for additional examples of hydromethylation or hydroalkylation). In these cases, simple hydrocarbon-, ether-or acetal-containing alcohols were broadly successful (24-30, 52-68% yield), as were substrates bearing tetrahydropyran (31 and 32, 73% and 55% yield, respectively), morpholine (33, 52% yield), lactam (34, 63% yield) or pyridine (35, 60% yield) heterocyclic functionality. Moreover, the functional group tolerance of this method allowed for retention of protic motifs such as amine derivatives or unprotected distal alcohols (36-40, 51-89% yield). The latter finding is particularly significant when considering the selectivity of NHC-mediated deoxygenation for activating less-substituted sites within diol substrates. As such, this protocol could enable the stepwise and site-selective elaboration of native polyols into complex scaffolds using olefin feedstock partners. Lastly, to rapidly produce drug-like, C(sp 3 )-rich molecular architecture from native functionality, we harnessed olefinalcohol coupling for the late-stage derivatization of medicinally-relevant scaffolds (Figure ). Using methanol, hydromethylated products were expediently furnished from bioactive compounds bearing a typically unreactive olefin within their structure, including the antimalarial quinine (41, 34% yield), the antibiotic retapamulin (42, 30% yield), common steroids (43, 70% yield) and the plant-derived stimulant picrotoxinin (44, 47% yield). Delightfully, this reactivity was also extendable to other quaternary carbon formations, as both the aforementioned substrates and a derivative of the muscular dystrophy therapeutic ataluren were efficiently hydroalkylated using diverse primary alcohols (45-48, 43-73% yield). Across all cases, the unique tolerance of this method for labile functionality (including readily-oxidized amines and sulfides, coordinating alcohols and pyridines, or oxidative additionprone 1,2,4-oxadiazoles) was critical for the generation of complex molecular architecture in an efficient manner.",

These large Stokes shifts suggest a phosphorescent nature of the process.

Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) for reaction monitoring was performed with alumina plates coated with Merck silica gel 60 F254 (layer thickness: 0.2 mm) or Merck silica gel 60 RP-18 F254 (layer thickness: 0.2 mm) and analyzed under UV-light (254 nm). As an alternative method for reaction monitoring, we used high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) or low resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LRMS-ESI). HPLC-MS analyses were performed using a Thermo Scientific Dionex UltiMate 3000 HPLC system in combination with a DAD detector (220/230/254 nm) and an Agilent ZORBAX ECLIPSE, XDB-C8 column (3.0 mm x 100 mm, 3.5 ¬µm). Elution was performed at room temperature under gradient conditions. Eluent A was water containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid; eluent B was methanol. Linear gradient conditions were as follows: 0-0.2 min: A=75%, B=25%; 0.2-6.0 min: linear increase to B=100%; 6.0-8.5 min: B=100%; 8.5-9.0 min: linear decrease to A=75%, B=25%; 9.0-12.0 min: A=75%, B=25%. A flow rate of 0.4 mL‚Ä¢min -1 was maintained during the entire elution. Mass detection was performed with a BRUKER amaZon SL mass spectrometer using ESI as ionization source. As an alternative method for low resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LRMS-ESI), we used an Advion expression¬Æ compact mass spectrometer (CMS) coupled with an automated TLC plate reader Plate Express¬Æ (Advion). Flash column chromatography was performed with hand packed Silica Columns 60M (0.040-0.063 mm, 230-400 mesh) as a stationary phase on a Biotage SP-1 or Selekt automated flash purification system with UV-Vis detector. Yields were not optimized. NMR spectra were recorded using either a Bruker Avance 400 ( 1 H: 400 MHz, C: 101 MHz), Bruker Avance DRX 500 ( 1 H: 500 MHz, C: 126 MHz), or a Bruker Avance 600 ( 1 H: 600 MHz, C: 151 MHz) instrument. The spectra are referenced against the NMR solvent and are reported as follows: 1 H: chemical shift Œ¥ (ppm), multiplicity (s = singlet, d = doublet, dd = doublet of doublets, t = triplet, m = multiplet, b = broad), integration, coupling constant (J in Hz). C: chemical shift Œ¥ (ppm), abbreviations: carbons that could not be found in C spectra (DEPTQ) but in HMBC or HSQC are additionally marked with a hashtag (#). Signals that are partially overlaid by a solvent signal are marked with an asterisk (*). The assignment resulted from HMBC and HSQC experiments. High resolution mass spectra were measured with a timsTOF Pro Mass Spectrometer from Bruker Daltonics using ESI as ionization source.

    "context": "With conditions in hand for iodo-and bromosulfonylation of 1, the scope of the reaction was studied (Figure ). Aryl sulfinates bearing neutral or electron-donating substituents(2a-2c) gave the corresponding sulfone BCP iodides and bromides 3a-3c in near quantitative yields (96-100%, up to ~2 g scale). Halogenated arenes were well-tolerated, particularly for BCP bromide synthesis (3d-3f, 50-100%). Good to excellent yields were also observed for electron-deficient aryl sulfonyl bromides 3g-Br-3i-Br (for example, the p-CF3 aryl sulfone 3i-Br was obtained in 97% yield from the isolated sulfonyl bromide intermediate on 0.7 g scale, or in 61% yield using a one-pot procedure); however the corresponding iodides performed less well, and typically benefited from cooling to -40 ¬∞C to limit competing desulfonylation. Sterically-encumbered o-tolyl and mesityl sulfinates proceeded smoothly, giving BCP iodide 3j-I in 88% yield, and mesityl adducts 3k-I and 3k- Br in 66% and 82% yield respectively. A lower yield of 3j-Br was observed (33%) due to competing benzylic bromination of the methyl group. Additional m-electron-withdrawing substituents were also accommodated, with 3,5-di-F and 3,5-di-CF3 arenes affording sulfonyl BCP halides 3l and 3m in 58-100% yield. The inferior reactivity observed with acetamide 2n was surprising, even on cooling to -40 ¬∞C, possibly due to competing reaction at the amide. A bis-arylsulfinate could even be used successfully to deliver bis-sulfonyl BCP iodide 3o-I and bromide 3o-Br in 26% and 92% yield respectively. [3.1.1]Propellane 4 is emerging as a convenient reagent to access novel m-substituted arene bioisosteres; 12 pleasingly, the addition of sulfonyl halides translated smoothly to this propellane, giving sulfonyl BCHep halide products in excellent yields (5a-I, 87% and 5a-Br, 100%).",

    "context": "After optimizing the reaction conditions, we explored the substrate scope. As shown in Figure , OTs and OTf substituted 4-tert-butylbenzene are effective electrophiles, yielding 52% and 78% of product 8, respectively. Other aryl bromides, including both electron-rich and electron-deficient arenes, were suitable electrophiles for this cross-coupling reaction (9 to 19). The aryl bromides with electron-rich substituents (8 to 14) delivered slightly higher yields (49% to 72%) compared to those with electron-deficient substituents (15 to 19, with yields ranging from 42% to 66%). This may be due to the low reactivity of electron-rich aryl bromides in the oxidative addition reaction with the Ni I intermediate, which slows down the competing homo-coupling reaction of aryl bromides. The aryl bromide electrophiles with various functional groups, including methoxy group (11 and 12), ester (15), fluoride (16), ketone (18), and trifluoromethyl group (19), as well as protection groups such as amide (13), acetal (14), and tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) (20 and 21), were found to be effective in this reaction.

While the C(sp 3 )-C(sp 2 ) cross-coupling product was not obtained when using ortho-substituted methoxy bromobenzene electrophile. When the aryl halide contains F, Cl, and Br, the C-Br bond is selectively functionalized. Yields of 54% and 61% were obtained for products 16 and 17, respectively, from 1-bromo-4-fluorobenzene and 1-bromo-4-chlorobenzene. For substrates with strong electron-withdrawing substituents such as methoxycarbonyl (15) and acetyl (18) groups, and œÄ-conjugation extended aryl groups (22), the use of the 2,2'-bpy ligand resulted in the most favorable results (with yields of 66%, 42%, and 51% for 15, 18, and 22, respectively).",

Fluorine-substituted 3Ca was also generated in a moderate yield and maintained good regioselectivity. 5-Benzyloxydihydronaphthalen-2-yl benzoxazole 3Da was synthesized with a 53% yield. These results indicated that electronic and positional variations on the aromatic ring on tetralone 4 did not significantly affect this reaction progress. We then assessed of this reaction with various benzoxazoles. Both 5-phenyl-and 5-alkyl-substituted benzoxazoles underwent this reaction, giving the corresponding enloate dance/coupling products in moderate yields (3Ab, 3Ac, and 3Ad).

The thiophene sulfonyl BCP bromides could be prepared on 2.5 g scale from the isolated sulfonyl bromides with equally impressive 98% yields for both substrates. 3-Pyrazole sulfinate 2r was similarly successful, giving the BCP iodide and bromide 3r-I/Br in 92% and 100% yields, respectively, whereas 2-pyrazole sulfinate gave a poor yield of the bromide 3s-Br (15%). 3-Furyl sulfonyl BCP bromide 3t-Br was achieved in 53% yield using PPh3‚Ä¢Br2 complex to prepare the sulfonyl bromide in situ. Substrates containing N-nucleophilic sites proved challenging, presumably due to competing reactivity with the sulfonyl halide: 13 oxazole 2u gave a low yield of the BCP iodide 3u-I (19%) but a 67% yield of the bromide 3u-Br. Iodosulfonylation of pyridylsulfinate 2v was unsuccessful, while the pyridyl sulfonyl bromide adducts 3v-Br-3x-Br were isolated in reduced yields of 15-31%, on up to 0.5 g scale. Pleasingly, we found that the methodology could be readily applied in pharmaceutical and agrochemical settings, successfully achieving BCP derivatives of vasodilating drug sildenafil (3y-I, 84% and 3y-Br, 82%) and the rice herbicide cafenstrole (3z-I, 55% and 3z-Br, 59%).",

    "answer": "Sulfone donor 6 has a reduction potential of -1.48 V, making it considerably more reducible than sulfone donor 4 (-1.82 V) and sulfone donor 5 (-1.70 V). This higher reducibility, which aligns well with the reduction potential of photocatalyst PC1 (-1.51 V), is crucial for its effective reaction to produce product 3 under the standard conditions.",
    "context": "Control experiments showed that the choice of sulfone donor, the reducing ability of the photocatalyst, Cu(I) catalyst, BTMG base, and photoirradiation were critical to achieving high efficiency for the N-glycosylation. Reduction potential measurements vs. SCE in CH3CN indicated that the BthSO2 donor 6 (E1/2 red = -1.48V) is considerably more reducible than 2-pyridyl sulfone 4 (E1/2 red = -1.82V) and phenyl sulfone 5 (E1/2 red = -1.70V). Neither 4 nor 5 can react with 2 to give 3 under our standard conditions. The reduction potential of PC1 ((E1/2 red [Ir III /Ir II ] = -1.51 V) matches well with sulfone donor 6. PC2 fac-Ir(ppy)3 (E1/2 red [Ir III /Ir II ] = -2.19 V) is slightly less effective but also worked well (entry 12). The addition of photocatalysts like [Ir(dtbbpy)(dFppy)2]PF6 (PC3), [Ir(dF(CF3)ppy)2 dtbbpy]PF6 (PC4), Ru(bpy)3Cl2 (PC5), or eosin Y (PC6) gave lower yields of 3 than the standalone Cu catalysis (entries 13-16 vs. 3). The combination of PC2 and chloride donor 1 did not furnish any product 3 under various conditions, indicating the importance of a delicate interplay between the Cu-mediated and photocatalystmediated pathways. No conversion of 6 took place in the absence of LED irradiation (entry 7). Irradiation with green LED gave a slightly lower yield of 3 than blue LED (entry 20). A sufficiently strong base was necessary for high efficiency. Both BTMG (pKa = 23.6 in MeCN) and 1,8-diazabicyclo(5.4.0)undec-7-ene (DBU, pKa = 24.3 in MeCN) could promote this reaction, but DBU exhibited lower reactivity (entry 17). Product 3 was formed in <5% yield when Et3N or K2CO3 was used as the base (entries 18, 19). Other Cu catalysts could also work but were not as effective as Cu(MeCN)4PF6 (See Supplementary Table ).

CH3CN and THF provided little amounts of the desired product (entry 21 and Supplementary Table & S5). The performance of the reaction diminished under air atmosphere (entry 23).

    "context": "Here we show another approach to tuning the microporosity in the amorphous solids of MOPs by systematically changing the composition of two mixed ligands in a series of MOPs. We chose an octahedral-type MOP because of its simpler geometry and fewer numbers of components than the prototypical cuboctahedral MOP. We newly synthesized two octahedral Rh(II)-based MOPs with 9H-carbazole dicarboxylate derivatives: [Rh12(HCz)12] (HCzRhMOP) and [Rh12(BnCz)12] (BnCzRhMOP), HCz = 9H-carbazole-3,6-dicarboxylate and BnCz = 9-benzyl-9H-carbazole-3,6-dicarboxylate. To tune the interaction between the MOPs, we further synthesized mixed-ligand H/BnCzRhMOPs of [Rh12(HCz)12-x(BnCz)x] in various ratios of HCz and BnCz (x = 1, 3, 6, 9 and 11 for HCz/BnCz = 11/1, 9/3, 6/6, 3/9 and 1/11, respectively). HCzRhMOP, H/BnCzRhMOPs and BnCzRhMOP showed the linear correlation of their porosity with the number of the benzyl groups. These results indicate that the systematic variation of MOP compositions highly influences the packing arrangement of MOPs and the resulting microporosities (Fig. ).

The curium complex has an M-N distance that is within error of the gadolinium analogue but is notably shorter than that of the samarium analogue.",

Surprisingly, the M-N distance observed in 1-Cm is within error of the 4f congener, 1-Gd, but is substantially shorter than its ionic radii-based analogue, 1-Sm. The M-N distance presented in 1-Sm is slightly shorter than that of a similar molecule, Cp3Sm(py) (py = pyridine), 2.656(3) √Ö. A longer distance would be anticipated in 1-Sm based on the provided steric bulk from the trimethylsilyl groups of Cp‚Ä≤ competing with 4,4‚Ä≤-bpy. However, 1-Gd exhibits a notable longer Gd-N distance in comparison to that reported in Cp3Gd(NH3), 2.501(6) √Ö, due to the significantly smaller size of the coordinated NH3. As there has been no single-crystal structural characterization of organometallic curium to date, comparison to similar coordination environments proves challenging. The Cm-N distance of 1-Cm is greater than those reported in Cm(HDPA)3‚Ä¢H2O (H2DPA = 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid) but less than Cm(S2CNEt2)3(N2C12H8). The average Cm-N distance of Cm(HDPA)3 is 2.541(4) √Ö Scheme 1. Addition of 4,4‚Ä≤-bpy to two equivalents of Cp‚Ä≤3M (M = Sm, Gd, Cm) yields (Cp‚Ä≤3M)2(Œº-4,4‚Ä≤-bpy). and 2.550(4) √Ö for the Œõ and Œî enantiomers, respectively, and the reported Cm-N distance Cm(S2CNEt2)3(N2C12H8) is 2.601(6) √Ö. Curium sets a trend for these bridged organometallic actinide systems in the trivalent state. Previously reported values of isostructural systems containing uranium and americium possess notably longer M-N bonds than 1-Cm: 2.626(7) √Ö, 2.618(2) √Ö, and 2.5962 (16) √Ö respectively, introducing a trend of decreasing M-N distances across the actinide series. This trend excludes thorium owing to its low stability in the trivalent state, resulting in the reduction of 4,4‚Ä≤-bpy and oxidation to Th 4+ . The M-Cent (Cent = Centroid) bond distances observed in 1-Sm, 1-Gd, and 1-Cm are 2.516(3) √Ö, 2.498(4) √Ö, and 2.517(3) √Ö, respectively. Distorted symmetry and steric competition resulting from the increased coordination number causes a deviation in M-Cent distances compared to their Cp‚Ä≤3M counterparts (Table ). A range of M-Cent distances from 2.498(2) √Ö to 2.538(2) √Ö is seen in 1-Cm, 2.496(3) √Ö to 2.537(3) √Ö in 1-Sm, and 2.477(4) √Ö to 2.523(4) √Ö in 1-Gd, presenting a statistically significant variation of about 0.04 √Ö in all three molecules. A decrease in M-Centavg is observed in comparison to isostructural uranium and americium systems. The average M-Cent length and range observed in 1-Gd are longer and spread over a broader range compared to the reported M-Cent distance range seen in Cp‚Ä≤3Gd, 2.434 √Ö -2.441 √Ö owing to increased coordination. Similarly, the Cent-M-Cent angles of 1-Sm, 1-Gd, and 1-Cm are lower than the reported Cent-M-Cent angles of Cp‚Ä≤3M (M = lanthanide), due to the effect of 4,4‚Ä≤-bpy on the coordination environment. The observed average Cent-M-Cent angle in 1-Cm is 117.3¬∞. The Cent-M-N angles of 1-Cm range from 93.761¬∞ to 103.628¬∞. This considerable difference can be attributed to the bulkiness of the trimethylsilyl groups of Cp‚Ä≤. Additionally, 4,4‚Ä≤-bpy is angled downward at just over 9¬∞, that is likely due to an interaction between hydrogen from the trimethylsilyl groups and nitrogen on the bridge.",

    "context": "Cu(II)-mediated C-H bond cleavage to obtain planar phospha [6]dication from P2-OMe leads to an unexpected stable diradical mixture (t1/2>10 days) which can be verified by a broad and pseudo-split ESR signal with a g value of 2.004 (Figure ). In addition, the mixture has an NIR absorption up to 1100 nm, as shown in Figure . According to the reaction path (Figures ), the cyclized radical product [PDC2-OMe] 2‚Ä¢4+ [(OTf)4] 4+ and the oxidative radical product [P2O-OMe] 2‚Ä¢2+ [(OTf)2] 2+ could be responsible for the multiple radical characters. In fact, this Cu(II)-mediated annulation processes a short lifetime radical mechanism, and the trace could be found by means of the UV-vis-NIR monitor. For example, the addition of excess Cu(OTf)2 leads to two new longwavelength absorption bands up to 1500 nm (Figure ). Nevertheless, the separation and purification of radical [PDC2-OMe] 2‚Ä¢4+ [(OTf)4] and nonradical [PDC3] 2+ [(OTf)2] 2-are unprocurable due to poor solubility. Contrastively, the P1 ligand suffers exclusively radicalization on the BINAP core to produce [PDC3] 2+ [(OTf)2] 2-with the planar topology.

Our objective was to introduce weak hydrogen bonds ). The whole crystal structure of UZIF-31 was determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) with help from the confirmed composition using 1 H-NMR spectroscopy (Figure ). The topology of UZIF-31 exhibited an unprecedented 4,4,4-c topology with the point symbol of (4 2 .6 2 .8 2 )(4 3 .6.8 2 )(4 3 .6 2 .8) named uft1. This novel topology, uft1, was documented in the personal topology repository and not observed in any materials even zeolites. Notably, the topology of uft1 exhibits the same topological network as PCOD 8095196, also known as 4,4,4T-3872HZ, which is among hypothetical zeolites proposed by Deem et al. Interestingly, the topology of UZIF-31 is exactly matched with one of Tier 1, T-50 (Figures and). Despite a slight distortion of Im, the difference in cell volume between UZIF-31 and the predicted structure was merely +6.14 %. During topological analysis of uft1, three types of tiles compose UZIF-31 (Figure ). One of the tiles is a ] cage, which is known as the t-cub, and the others ([4 4 .6 6 .8 2 ] and [4 6 .6 2 .8 2 .12 2 ] cages) are not observed in any zeolites. The largest pore opening with a 12-membered ring (MR) was observed within the surrounding [4 6 .6 2 .8 2 .12 2 ] cage. UZIF-32 and -33 (uft2) crystallized within the orthorhombic Cmmm (No. 65) space group. The composition of crystals was confirmed by SCXRD and 1 H-NMR (Tables and; Figures and). Thus far, due to the identical net, the topological analysis of UZIF-32 has been considered the same as that of UZIF-33 for clarity. UZIF-33 also presented a novel 4,4,4-c topology with the point symbol of (4.6 4 .8)(4 2 .6 3 .8)(4 3 .6 2 .8) named uft2, not encountered in any other porous materials, including zeolite structures. Similar to uft1, the topology of uft2 shows the identical topological network with PCOD 8096930, also referred to as 4,4,4T-3884HZ, in hypothetical zeolites suggested by Deem et al.

    "context": "These substituents can substantially perturb the [3]-ladderene geometries relative to 1 to minimize closed-shell repulsions. We defined two parameters, an intramolecular distance, r, and a folding angle Œ∏, to quantify the geometrical distortions (Figure ). The parameter r is the distance between the centroids of the two œÄ-bonds, and Œ∏ is the angle between the planes of the four-membered rings. These parameters are r = 2.98 √Ö and Œ∏ = 118¬∞ in 1; r = 1.56 √Ö and Œ∏ = 90¬∞ in 2; Œ∏ = 114¬∞ in 3, optimized with PBE0/cc-pVDZ. R1 tetra-CH3-substitutions increase the r to 3.02 √Ö. The CH3 at R2 show opposite effects; the r and Œ∏ values decrease to 2.89 √Ö and 115¬∞, maximizing the distance between adjacent substituents (Figure ). The CH3 at R2 bends the [3]-ladderenes 3¬∞ more than the CH3 at R1, introducing additional strain at the bridgehead carbons, and 4'' is 0.46 eV higher than 4' (Table ). The tetra-CF3-and cPr-substitution lead to similar geometrical distortions: the r and Œ∏ increase to 2.98-3.02 √Ö and 120¬∞ when substituting R1, whereas the r and Œ∏ values reduce to 2.86-2.87 √Ö and 114-116¬∞ when substituting R2. The energies of 7' and 10' are 0.21 and 0.59 eV lower than 7'' and 10'', respectively (Table ). Compared to 1, the r and Œ∏ parameters in the octa-substituted [3]-ladderenes, 4, 7, and 10 decreased to 2.89-2.95 √Ö and 116-118¬∞. It suggests the repulsive steric interaction at R2 generates the dominant geometrical distortions. The repulsive steric interactions at R1 enlarges the angle in the 4œÄ-disrotatory electrocyclic ring-opening products to 115-117¬∞, compared to 3 (Œ∏ = 114¬∞); the steric clash at R2 reduces the angle to 106-112¬∞. Figure shows that the substituents at R1 and R2 destabilize the reaction energies by 0.24-0.55 and 0.56-0.77 eV, respectively. The greater destabilization at R2 suggests stronger steric repulsions due to the inflexibility of the substituent at the bridgehead position. The octa-substitution additively increases the destabilizing effects of the R1 and R2 tetra-substitution. The reaction energy of 6, 9, and 12 is 0.68-2.34 eV higher than 1. The octa-substitutions with CF3 and cPr switch the reaction energies from exergonic to endergonic (0.65 and 0.30 eV), indicating unfavorable 4œÄ-disrotatory electrocyclic ring-opening to 9 and 12.",

The ARGET ATRP method is advantageous because it overcomes the oxygen sensitivity of traditional ATRP by continuously regenerating the Cu I activator with a reducing agent, thereby maintaining the necessary equilibrium for the reaction.",

    "context": "Transition-metal-catalyzed additions across œÄ-systems have been extensively explored and have similarly been employed to control the reactivity of 2-azetines (Fig. ). In this area, Zhang and co-workers developed a nickel-catalyzed aryldifluoroalkylation across the alkene of 2-azetines (44) that affords trans-disubstituted azetidines (45). This metalcatalyzed transformation of 2-azetines (44) proceeded with a diastereoselectivity greater than 20:1, and produced azetidines with ester or amide functionality for subsequent modifications such as amide couplings. Functionalized Œ≤-lactams are a well-established motif that have demonstrated medicinal properties. 62-65 1-Azetines have been identified by researchers as precursors to functionalized Œ≤-lactam rings under a variety of reaction conditions (Fig 4D). The first example of a 1-azetine being converted to a Œ≤-lactam was disclosed by Atkinson and co-workers. The Atkinson group showed that two different 1-azetines (46, R 1 =Cl or MeO, R 2 =Ph, R 3 =Cl, R 4 =Me, R 5 =H) were converted to the same Nhydro Œ≤-lactam (47) upon exposure to 10% hydrochloric acid. Likewise, Aue and Thomas were able to synthesize a N-methyl Œ≤-lactam (47, R 2 =R 3 =Me, R 4 =R 5 =H) from a 1-azetine (46, R 1 =OMe) via a thermally induced Chapman rearrangement. Ghosez and co-workers developed a general protocol that allows conversion of a 1-azetine (46, R 1 =NMe2, R 2 =R 3 =Me, R 4 =Ph, R 5 =H) to Œ≤-lactams with an N-electrophile bond (47) in the presence of an electrophile such as methyl iodide or acrylonitrile following basic hydrolysis.

The authors observed that anhydrous hydrochloric acid in ethereal solvents reverted 1-azetines (46) to the corresponding Œ≤-lactams (47) from which they were formed. The four protocols described (vide supra) allow access to highly functionalized Œ≤-lactams from 1-azetines and proceed through different mechanisms, which highlights the potential of 1-azetines as useful building blocks to access Œ≤-lactam rings.",

A wide range of aryl halides with electron-donating groups (3b-3d) or electron-withdrawing groups (3i-3v) were viable substrates under standard conditions. Moreover, the reaction was not sensitive to steric resistance, and the ortho-substituted substrates (3e, 3f) were converted to the desired products in good yields with high er values.

    "answer": "Utilizing Pt nanoparticles with CdS microspheres leads to the production of 2,5-diformylfuran with an AQY of 12.3% at 450 nm, whereas replacing Pt with MoS2 results in both 2,5-diformylfuran and a pinacol-like coupling product, as the lower H2-evolution activity of MoS2 prolongs the lifetime of hydroxyalkyl radicals, encouraging their dimerization.",

The AQY of 2,5-diformylfuran is 12.3% at 450 nm. When H2O was replaced by D2O, only H2 evolved. When MoS2 was used instead of Pt as a co-catalyst, in addition to 2,5-diformylfuran, pinacol-like coupling product formed, suggesting that in the presence of less active H2-evolution catalyst, MoS2, lifetime of hydroxyalkyl radicals is longer, which favors their dimerization.",

Additionally, analyses using AIM did not identify any bond critical points between the tetrel atoms and the cobalt center, all of which indicate only a weak interaction rather than a covalent bond.",
    "context": "A recent work from our group has successfully utilised the reaction of white phosphorus (P4) with heterobimetallic complexes to prepare unusual polyphosphorus compounds. Using this strategy, we have now synthesised the heavy tetraphospholide anions SnP4 2-and PbP4 2-. These hitherto unknown ÔÅ∞-aromatic molecules are stabilised by the coordination to two cobalt atoms in the triple-decker sandwich compounds [(Œ∑ 4 -tBu2C2P2)2Co2(Œº,Œ∑ 5 :Œ∑ 5 -P4Tt)] [Tt = Sn (6), Pb (7)]. We describe the structural and spectroscopic characterization of these complexes and analyse the electronic structure of the P4Tt 2‚îÄ ligands with quantum chemical methods. The molecular structures of 1-3 were determined by singlecrystal X-ray diffraction. Since all three structures share the same motif, only the molecular structure of 2 is displayed in Figure , while those of 1 and 3 are shown in the SI (Figures and). The cobalt atoms feature Œ∑ 4 -coordinated 1,5-cyclooctadiene and 1,3-diphosphacyclobutadiene ligands, while the tetrel atom (Ge, Sn, or Pb) is in a pseudo-two-coordinate environment by terphenyl-substituent and one of the P atoms of the diphosphacyclobutadiene ligand. The Tt-P bond lengths in 1-3 (2.3946(8) √Ö, 2.6442(7) √Ö, 2.7402(10) √Ö, respectively) are similar to those of tertiary phosphine adducts of tetrelylenes. The Tt-Co distances in 1-3 (Ge-Co 2.8434(6) √Ö, Sn-Co 2.9534(5) √Ö, Pb-Co: 3.0318(6) √Ö) are longer than the sum of their covalent radii (‚àërGeCo 2.70 √Ö, ‚àërSnCo 2.89 √Ö, ‚àërPbCo 2.96 √Ö). These parameters suggest the absence of a covalent metal-metal bond, which is in line with quantum chemical calculations (vide infra). By contrast, a previously reported, related cluster compound (Ar‚Ä≤SnCo)2 features strong covalent Sn-Co bonds, which even have partial multiple bond character. It is noteworthy that although the Tt-Co and Tt-P distances for 1-3 increase down the group, the bond angles are approximately the same (C1-Tt-Co1 127¬∞-129¬∞, C1-Tt-P1 102¬∞-103¬∞). As a consequence of the relatively short atomic radius of germanium, the terphenyl substituent and the Co( ), C1-Sn1-P1 102.17 (7). This is presumably due to the large chemical shift anisotropy of the signals and/or relaxation effects as previously observed for the (Ar‚Ä≤SnCo)2 cluster. Intrinsic bond orbital (IBO), natural bond orbital (NBO) and Atoms in Molecules (AIM) analyses of DFT calculated electron densities were employed to analyse the bonding situation in 1-3. The IBO analyses show the expected bond-like localised molecular orbitals. Additionally, there is a delocalised MO between the tetrel, coordinating phosphorus and cobalt centres, but with low contributions from Co (1: Ge (24%) Co (8%) P (59%), 2: Sn (14%) Co (10%) P (59%), 3: Pb (13%) Co (10%) P (59%)). The Wiberg bond indices for Ge-Co, Sn-Co and Pb-Co likage in 1-3 (0.20, 0.15 and 0.13, respectively) are lower than expected for a covalent bond. In line with the results from DFT, the AIM analysis shows bond critical point (BCP) between cobalt and phosphorus, as well as the tetrel atoms and phosphorus (see Figure and SI). However, no BCPs were found between the tetrel atoms and the cobalt centre. All these results indicate the presence of only a weak interaction between Tt and Co. It was also possible to synthesise the homoleptic tin(II) complex Sn[Co(Œ∑ 4 -P2C2tBu2)(COD)]2 (4) by reacting E with commercially available Sn(acac)2 (Figure ). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction on 4 revealed that the tin atom is coordinated by the two P atoms of the diphosphacyclobutadiene ligands with Sn-P distances (Sn1-P1 2.6490 (10), Sn1-P2 2.6484(10) √Ö) similar to 2 and a P-Sn-P angle of 102.17 Having compounds 1-4 at hand, we studied their reactivity towards P4 to ascertain whether they can be used as precursors to novel polyphosphorus compounds. Reactions between 1 and P4 were unsuccessful. While no reaction occurs at ambient temperature, heating to 55 ¬∞C affords an intractable mixture of products according to 31 P NMR spectra (see Figure , SI). By contrast, reactions of 2 or 4 with P4 at elevated temperatures afford dark red, crystalline compound [(tBu2C2P2)2Co2(Œº,Œ∑ 5 :Œ∑ 5 -SnP4)] (6) in each case (Figure ). When using 2, separation of 6 from the terphenyl containing by-products proved difficult due to their similar solubility. Fortunately, reaction of 4 with P4 forms 6 selectively at ambient temperature, with 1,5-cycloctadiene being the only by-product, making isolation facile and allowing the crystallographic characterisation of 6 by singlecrystal X-ray diffraction (Figure ). The crystallographic analysis reveals the formation of a triple decker complex of two (Œ∑ 4 -P2C2tBu2)Co units and a planar cyclo-SnP4 middle deck, for which a pronounced alternation of the P-P bond lengths is observed. The P-P bonds adjacent to the Sn atom (P1-P2 Internal 2.1101( ) and P3-P4 2.094(4) √Ö) approach the range for a P=P double bond. The P2-P3 bond length (2.2296(11) √Ö) suggests the presence of a single bond. The bond lengths between phosphorus and tin (av. P-Sn 2.52865( ) √Ö are comparable to the single bonds found in diphosphastannylenes. The 31 P{ 1 H} spectrum of 6 shows one singlet and two multiplets with an integral ratio of 4:2:2. The singlet at Œ¥ = 67.1 ppm can be assigned to the P atoms within the P2C2tBu2 rings. One of the two multiplet signals (Œ¥ = 29.6 and 77.0 ppm), the highfield shifted signal shows coupling to 117/119 Sn, allowing for its definitive assignment to the P atoms adjacent to the Sn atom (P1 and P4). Simulation of the 31 P{ 1 H} spectrum by an iterative fitting procedure gave a 1 JPP coupling constant of ‚îÄ434.7 Hz for the P1-P2/P3-P4 pairs, whereas the 1 JPP coupling for P2-P3 (magnetically not equivalent) it is ‚îÄ289.0 Hz (see Figure , SI). A 119 Sn NMR spectrum of 6, shows a broad triplet at Œ¥ = 339.7 ppm with a 1 JSnP coupling constant of 797 Hz, which is in agreement with the simulated 31 P{ 1 H} NMR spectrum (see the SI). The line broadening of the 119 Sn NMR is likely due to interactions with the quadrupolar 59 Co nuclei. 22 ), Sn1-P4 2.5375( ), P1-P2 2.1101( ), P2-P3 2.2296( ), P3-P4 2.1104( ), Co1-Co2 3.050, P1-Sn1-P4 88.17( ), Sn1-P1-P2 118.23(4), P1-P2-P3 107.96( ), P2-P3-P4 107.60( ), P3-P4-Sn1 118.02(4); c) Sections of the measured (upward) and simulated (downward) P{ 1 H} NMR spectrum of 6.",

    "context": "A hybrid material composed of Ag nanoparticles (~66.4 wt. % of silver) deposited in situ at g-CN fibers upon calcining Ag-cyanoguanidine complex produces formaldehyde from methanol. Binuclear complex, [Me2(C16H33)2N]4[Pt2(pop-BF2)4] (see Figure for chemical structure), which comprise chromophore (onset of absorption at ~380 nm), photoredox and H2-evolution sites (Pt), mediate dehydrogenation of benzylic alcohols and nitrogen-containing heterocycles (Figure ). When reaction was performed in homogeneous fashion, i.e., using water/organic solvent mixture (2:1) in which all components are fully soluble, the catalyst yields up to 78% diphenylbutandiol. Employing two-phase system, water/CH2Cl2 (1:3) and the phase transfer reagent Bu4NCl, shifted selectivity completely to acetophenone. K4[Pt2(pop-BF2)4], however, failed to enable dehydrogenation of aliphatic alcohols. [Me2(C16H33)2N]4[Pt2(pop-BF2)4], which excited state is a stronger oxidant compared to K4[Pt2(pop-BF2)4], Ered +0.85 vs. +0.70 V (Fc + /Fc), 298 catalyzes dehydrogenation of secondary aliphatic alcohols upon irradiation at 365 nm. While primary alcohols, such as ethanol and n-butanol gave the corresponding aldehydes with <10% yield, butanediol-1,4 and pentanediol-1,5 gave Œ≥-butyrolactone and Œ¥-valerolactone with yields as high as 83%. KIE values (kH/kD = 3.35) obtained from intra-and intermolecular competition experiments revealed that cleavage of C(sp 3 )-H bond in Œ±-position to hydroxyl group is the rate-limiting step. Dehydrogenation of indoline in the presence of styrene gives phenylethyl indole, which supports involvement of Pt2-hydride and Pt2-CH(CH3)Ph, i.e., Pt acts as a catalytic site, while the reaction proceeds via inner sphere atom abstraction. Given that in anhydrous environment, pinacol coupling product is formed, it is likely that intermediary ketyl radicals remain bound to Pt long enough so that dimerization competes effectively with hydrogen atom transfer with the liberation of H2 and aldehyde. A catalytic system composed [Mes-Acr-Me]ClO4, thiophosphoric acid and Ni(Tf2)2 enables dehydrogenation of aliphatic alcohols to aldehydes (Figure ). Using the same catalytic system, esters were obtained from aldehydes and trichloroethanol with evolution of one H2 equivalent. Comparison of the ketone yield obtained from benzhydrol (11%) and dicyclohexylmethanol (72%) revealed that the reaction proceeds via Œ≤-hydride elimination from Ni species -the latter has Œ≤-C-H bond, while the former -does not. Dehydrogenation of admanatanol gave non-enolizable ketone with low (27%) yield suggesting the reaction proceeds via enol intermediate. Using cyclododecanol-d4 as the substrate, gave ketone with relatively high (84%) enrichment in H vs. D, again suggesting formation of enol. CdS modified with Ni (0) nanoparticles, which were photochemically deposited using NiCl2 enables dehydrogenation of methanol to formaldehyde.

    "answer": "Ru-3 exhibited catalytic activity comparable to Ru-1 at 120 ¬∞C. The results imply that the trans ligands in these complexes likely remain coordinated to ruthenium or dissociate only very slowly, even under harsh thermal conditions.",
    "context": "Interestingly, the initial screening shows that Ru-3 exhibits high catalytic activity, comparable to Ru-1 at 120 ¬∞C (Entry 5 vs Entry 1). At the same temperature, Ru-2 and the phosphine complexes Ru-6 and Ru-7 also demonstrate good conversion rates (75%, 99%, and 94%, respectively) and yields towards GVL (76%, 87%, and 82%, respectively, entries 3, 9, and 11). In contrast, Ru-4, Ru-5, and Ru-11 show lower conversion rates (entries 7, 8, and 13). Based on ATR-IR data, hydride NMR shifts, and XRD bond lengths, this outcome was expected for the DMF complex (Ru-4) but unexpected for the DMSO complex (Ru-5). Moreover, the vastly different outcomes based on different trans ligands suggests that these ligands, or at least most of them, either stay coordinated to Ru or dissociate only slowly under these thermally harsh conditions.",

The structure of 6c was confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction. 17 Furthermore, 1,4-and 1,2-difluorobenzene provided the corresponding fluoro substituted dibenzofurans 6e and 6f in reasonable yield. Finally, the 2bromophenyl acetates 3 coupling partner was varied delivering 6d'-e' and 6g-i in 39-64% yield. Here, dibenzofurans 6e/e' and 6i have been reported as precursors for the synthesis of host materials for blue phosphorescent OLEDs.

    "question": "What role do tetra-alkyl ammonium chlorides play in enhancing the solubility of the reduced anthraquinone derivatives when CO‚ÇÇ is present?",
    "answer": "Tetra-alkyl ammonium chlorides, when used as supporting salts, prevent the formation of bright yellow precipitates by forming loose ion pairs with the reduced anthraquinones. This looser pairing, which includes more water molecules separating the ions, weakens Coulomb attractions and leads to clear, transparent bright yellow solutions.",
    "context": "Informed by a decade of endeavors in developing aqueous anthraquinone flow batteries, 35-41 we selected three anthraquinone derivatives that are aqueous-soluble at neutral pH: 2,7-disulfonated anthraquinone (AQDS), 1,8-bis(2-(2-(2-hydroxyethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)anthracene-9,10-dione (AQ-1,8-3E-OH), and 2,2‚Ä≤-((9,10-dioxo-9,10dihydroanthracene-2,6-diyl)bis(oxy))-dipropionic acid (2,6-D2PEAQ) (Figure ). Although those quinones show decent aqueous solubility in both oxidized and reduced states, bright yellow precipitates formed when CO2 was introduced to the reduced electrolytes. The yellow precipitates did not form, and clear solutions were afforded when tetra-alkyl ammonium chlorides were used as the supporting salts (Figure , Table ). Specifically, substituting 1 M NaCl with 1 M tetramethylammonium chloride (TMACl) as the supporting salt in 0.1 M AQDS electrolyte (Figure ), replacing 1 M KCl with 1 M tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBACl) as the supporting salt in 0.1 M 2,6-D2PEAQ (Figure ) or in 0.1 M AQ-1,8-3E-OH electrolytes produce transparent bright yellow solutions. One plausible explanation is that the bulky, amphiphilic tetra-alkyl ammonium cations and Q(CO2)2 2-can form loose ion pairs rather than the tight ion pairs between alkali metal cations and Q(CO2)2 2-. There are more water molecules separating positively and negatively charged ions in loose ion pairs than in tight ion pairs, weakening the Coulomb attraction and enhancing solubility. However, the bulkiness of tetra-alkyl ammonium cations causes extremely high cell resistance (Figure ) in the flow cell systems because, in such cells, cation-exchange membranes must be used, resulting in prohibitively high energetic cost. Inspired by the observation of dramatic change in aqueous solubility of reduced AQs in the presence of CO2 caused by tetra-alkyl ammonium salts (Figure , Table ), we hypothesized that anthraquinone derivatives tethered with bulky alkyl ammonium cations via covalent bonds might not only have high aqueous solubility in all states, but also be compatible with anion exchange membranes: the oxidized forms are positively charged and the reduced forms are charge-neutral but large in size, with correspondingly low expected cross-over rates. We designed and synthesized 1,4-, 1,5-, 1,8-, and 2,6-bis [3-(trimethylammonio)propyl]-anthraquinone (BTMAPAQs) in which the numbers represent the positions of water-solubilizing chains (TMAP) bonded to anthraquinone (AQ) core. Of the four isomers, 2,6-BTMAPAQ exhibits very limited solubility (< 0.1 M) even in its oxidized state (Table ); 1,8-BTMAPAQ(CO2)2 2-becomes soluble when TBA + is used as the supporting salt cation (Figure ); 1,4-, and 1,5-BTMAPAQs are soluble in all states even if KCl is used as the supporting salt. Therefore, 1,4-, 1,5-, and 1,8-BTMAPAQs (Figure ) were investigated for electrochemical CO2 capture. . (e) NMR specimens, from left to right in the same order as the molecular structures in (d), and their 1 H NMR (f) and 13 C NMR (g) spectra. Note that 1 H NMR peak broadening was initially observed from the electrochemically reduced aqueous quinone due to the occurrence of residual radicals, but addition of a tiny amount of HCl afforded well-defined peak splitting in the aromatic region (Figure , orange). The chemical shift at 124.6 ppm in 1,5-BTMAPAQ(CO2)2 2-(Figure , purple, identified with asterisk) is from the dissolved CO2. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to investigate BTMAPAQs in buffered and unbuffered solutions. As shown in Figure , at pH 7 in N2, 1,5-BTMAPAQ exhibits a redox potential of -0.465 V vs. SHE with a peak separation of 90 mV. When the solution was constantly purged with CO2, the major cathodic peak appears at -0.51 V along with a minor cathodic peak at -0.28 V (Figure ), which might be caused by a CO2 buffering effect, enabling 1,5-BTMAPAQ to partially undergo a PCET process. The anodic peak of 1,5-BTMAPAQ largely shifts to +0.28 V, suggesting that extra energy is required to trigger the electrochemical oxidation: 1,5-BTMAPAQ(CO2)2 2-√† 1,5-BTMAPAQ + 2CO2 + 2e -. Similar electrochemical behaviors were also shown by 1,4-and 1,8-BTMAPAQs.",

For example, one eight-membered cyclic alkene produced a cis to trans ratio of 6.25:1 with the cis isomer isolable at analytical purity, while another case using 1,5-cyclooctadiene gave a 1:1 mixture with the trans product confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction.",
    "context": "Figure depicts the array of aliphatic alkenes that participate in efficient aziridination. Yields are based on isolated N-pyridinium aziridines from reactions on 0.30 mmol scale; in some cases, both NMR and isolated yields are provided to emphasize that aziridination is typically efficient but isolation of highly polar N-pyridinium aziridines can be challenging. Cyclic alkenes (cyclohexene, cyclopentene, cyclooctene, and 3-carene) engaged in efficient aziridination to afford pyridinium aziridines 5a to 5d, respectively. Five-and six-membered aziridines are formed with exclusively cis-stereochemistry. For 8-membered cyclic alkenes, both cis-and trans-aziridines are observed (c-5c : t-5c = 6.25 : 1.00; 73% yield). Cis-5c could be isolated at analytical purity and the stereochemical assignment was based on measured coupling constants in the 1 H NMR spectrum. Assignment of cis-/ trans-mixtures was bolstered by aziridination with 1,5cyclooctadiene 5f, which afforded a 1.0 : 1.0 c-5f : t-5f mixture (69% yield, Figure ). The transstereochemistry of t-5f was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Norbornene undergoes exo-aziridination to afford 5e in 69% yield; the stereochemistry of aziridination was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) following cross coupling (vide infra). Terminal alkenes with different functional groups including alkyl halide, ester, nitrile, and azide underwent aziridination with good yield (5g to 5p).

    "question": "How does the DSC experiment demonstrate that ZIF compounds can be vitrified using ball milling at room temperature?",
    "answer": "The DSC experiment shows a well-defined glass transition signal in ZIF glass formers after only 5 minutes of ball milling, indicating that the materials transition to a supercooled liquid upon heating. This confirms that vitrification is achieved by room temperature ball milling rather than by heating past the melting points and melt-quenching.",
    "context": "With the aim of screening the samples for thermal phase changes, additional cyclic DSC experiments (two upscans, one downscan) were performed between ambient temperature and Td also under N2 atmosphere (Figures 6, S74-77 and S85). Excitingly, the ZIFs which are known glass formers (ZIF-62(M), ZIF-4(M), ZIF-zni(Zn), ZIF-76/UC-5 and TIF-4) exhibit a welldefined glass transition signal in the first upscan of the DSC already after only 5 minutes of PSBM (Figures and). Hence, these PSBM-amorphized materials represent ZIF MIGs that transition to a supercooled liquid upon heating. This proves that the vitrification of these compounds can be achieved by ball milling at room temperature instead of heating across the materials' melting points, followed by melt-quenching. The DSC data of both ZIF-4(Zn/Co) and ZIF-zni(Zn/Co) reveal distinct thermal characteristics (Figure and). Similar to crystalline ZIF-4(Zn), which recrystallizes to ZIF-zni(Zn) after thermal amorphization, the MIGs ZIF-4(Zn)-5min, -10min and -15min, also recrystallize to the ZIF-zni(Zn) polymorph after passing through their glass transition (confirmed by variable temperature XRPD, Figure ).

    "question": "Why is the oxidation to monoanions challenging, and how do the two oxidants used influence the outcome of oxidizing (NBu4)2tripak (2-a)?",

When (NBu4)2tripak (2-a) is oxidized with Ce(IV) in the form of (NBu4)2[Ce IV (NO3)6], a mixed-valence salt forms in which each tripak anion is accompanied by 1.5 NBu4+ cations, indicating both tripak1‚Äì and tripak2‚Äì coexist. In contrast, using [Fe III (phen)3](PF6)3 as the oxidant in MeCN leads to a smooth reaction that yields a tripak1‚Äì salt incorporating the diamagnetic [Fe II (phen)3]2+ countercation and PF6‚Äì as an additional counteranion.",
    "context": "Oxidation to monoanions is particularly challenging as the electrochemical stability window for this valence state calculated as the difference between Ered 1-/0 and Eox 2-/1-(see Table ) is narrow: 285 mV in THF, 227 mV in MeCN, 158 mV in DCM and only 109 mV in DMF. A suitable oxidant needs to meet several requirements: 1e -oxidation must take place in a narrow electrochemical window, the oxidant must be soluble either in THF or MeCN and should facilitate the removal of the redundant organic cations. Ce(IV) in the form of the tetrabutylammonium salt of [Ce IV (NO3)6] 2-anion: (NBu4)2[Ce IV (NO3)6] (CTAN) was found to be suitable (Ce IV /Ce III couple E1/2 = +0.610 V vs Fc/Fc + in MeCN, Figure in the SI). However, the corresponding oxidation of (NBu4)2tripak (2-a) resulted in the formation of a mixed-valence salt, in which each tripak anion was accompanied by 1.5 NBu4 + cations: (NBu4)1.5tripak‚Ä¢4THF (1-b) that leads to the conclusion that it comprises both tripak 1-and tripak 2-in a 1:1 ratio.

    "question": "What do the measured low quantum yields reveal about the reaction mechanism?",
    "answer": "The measured quantum yields, which are much less than one, indicate that a chain reaction is unlikely to play a significant role in the process, although a short, inefficient chain mechanism cannot be completely ruled out.",
    "context": "To assess the potential contribution of a chain mechanism, we determined the quantum yield (Œ¶) of the reaction. Using potassium ferrioxalate actinometry, we established a radiant flux of 9.6 ¬± 0.6 nE/s. 32a, Irradiating the reaction with substrate 1a for a one-hour under identical conditions gave a quantum yield of Œ¶Ce = 0.0025 ¬± 0.0008 and Œ¶Ce-free = 0.00111 ¬± 0.00008 (see SI for details). Theese low quantum yields (Œ¶ ‚â™ 1) suggest that a chain reaction is unlikely but cannot be entirely ruled out based on these experiments alone. 32c Poor excited-state quenching kinetics may also contribute to the low Œ¶-values, as indicated by our steady-state emission kinetics experiments. 32c Additionally, Julia's pioneering work on HAT cyclizations of C(sp¬≥-H) acids shows that short, inefficient chains are possible. Based on these mechanistic investigations, we propose the following tentative catalytic cycles (Scheme 3). Under cerium-employing conditions A, we propose an Xligand exchange between the putative complex [Et4N]3[Ce III Cl6] and LiTFA to give a Ce(III)‚Ä¢O2CCF3 complex. The Œ≤-ketoester substrates then coordinate with this Ce(III)carboxylate, triggering a metalation deprotonation event that exchanges carboxylate and enolate ligands. The newly formed ketoester‚Ä¢Ce(III) complex is then oxidized by photoexcited 9,10-DPA* to give a ketoester‚Ä¢Ce(IV) complex and radical anion 9,10-DPA ‚Ä¢-(E1/2(DPA/DPA ‚Ä¢-) = -1.80 V vs SCE in MeCN). The Ce(IV)‚Ä¢ketoester complex may then undergo thermal or photochemical LMCT, oxidizing the ketoester to furnish radical II and reducing Ce(IV) back to /PhS -) = +0.16 V vs SCE in MeCN). Thiolate V then deprotonates trifluoroacetic acid, regenerating carboxylate X and yielding TRIPSH (VI) (pKa(S-H) ~7 in water, pKa(CF3COO-H) -0.25 in water). HAT from TRIPSH (VI) to C-centred radical III regenerates thiyl species IV simultaneously forming the closed shell ketolactone product 2a (BDE(TRIPS-H) ~83 kcal/mol, BDE (primary alkyl C-H) ~100 kcal/mol, kHAT ~1x10 8 M -1 s -1 ). Activation of the substrate differs under Ce-free conditions (B) compared to Ce-conditions (A). We propose that dicarbonyl substrates bind LiTFA, forming a PCETcompetent substrate‚Ä¢LiTFA complex VII. This cvomplex can undergo a MS-PCET with photoexcited 9,10-DPA*, transferring a proton to LiTFA while reducing the photocatalyst simultaneously (BDE(PhO-H) ~92 kcal/mol, 37 effective BDFE ~91 kcal/mol, see SI).

    "context": "The activity of [BS-Fe-bTAML] -‚Ä¢ hCAII TS was evaluated for the hydroxylation of the ethylbenzene derivative 1. Gratifyingly, the activity of [BS-Fe-bTAML] -‚Ä¢ hCAII TS was significantly improved compared to both the free cofactor and the wild-type ArHase (two fold for the free cofactor and 1.8 fold for [BS-Fe-bTAML] -‚Ä¢ hCAII WT , Table , entry 3). Such activity enhancement was not observed with the previously-reported biotinylated-[Fe-TAML] ‚Ä¢ streptavidin system. The affinity of [BS-Fe-bTAML] -for hCAII TS was comparable to hCAII WT (52 ¬± 8 nM, Table , Figure ). Differential scanning fluorimetry confirmed that the melting temperature of hCAII TS increased by 14 ¬∫C compared to hCAII WT (i.e. 71 ¬∫C and 57 ¬∫C, Figure ). Accordingly, we selected hCAII TS for the remainder of this study. Next, we investigated whether the hydroxylation proceeds in cell lysates using E. coli BL21(DE3) cells harboring a plasmid encoding hCAII TS . Gratifyingly, upon cell lysis and thermal treatment at 55 ¬∫C for 30 minutes, followed by addition of [BS-Fe-bTAML] -, the ethylbenzene derivative 1 (2500 equiv. vs. [BS-Fe-bTAML] -) and H2O2 (5000 equiv. vs. [BS-Fe-bTAML] -), we were delighted to detect the alcohol 2 and the ketone 3, albeit in significantly lower yield compared to the purified ArHase (17 vs. 2140 TTON, Figure ). Upon increasing the number of equivalents of H2O2 (50,000 equiv. vs. [BS-Fe-bTAML] -), yields (1929 TTON) comparable to those of the purified ArHase were obtained. We surmise that the background activity resulting from catalysis with the free cofactor in the empty plasmid cell-lysates (1020 TTON, corresponding to ca. 53% of the TTON for ethylbenzene 1) should remain constant during the directed evolution campaign, thus enabling to detect improved ArHase activity resulting from [BS-Fe-bTAML] -‚Ä¢ hCAII TS mutants. Accordingly, we set out to evolve the ArHase performance using heat-treated E. coli cell lysates.",

    "context": "In conclusion, we demonstrated the synthesis of three new RhMOPs covalently grafted with photodimerizable coumarin side chains (C10-Coumarin-RhMOP, C3-Coumarin-RhMOP, and 12:12 C10-Coumarin/OH-RhMOP), as verified by NMR, UV-Vis spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry experiments. Irradiation of low-concentration RhMOP solutions at 350 nm triggered the intramolecular dimerization of their coumarin side chains, with C10-Coumarin-RhMOP exhibiting the highest dimerization quantum yield due to the high density and conformational flexibility of the coumarin chains. Irradiation of high-concentration C10-Coumarin-RhMOP solutions enabled their direct polymerization into dense thin films connected entirely through cyclobutane crosslinks. In contrast, coordination-driven polymerization of C10-Coumarin-RhMOP into a colloidal gel, followed by site-selectively irradiation, afforded dual coordination/covalent RhMOP gels, which exhibited equivalent porosity and greater mechanical strength compared to their solely coordination-linked counterparts. Dissociation of coordination crosslinkers from the doubly crosslinked networks afforded solely covalent Coumarin-RhMOP gels, which are among the most readily deformable and chemically robust MOP gels reported to date, with structures and mechanical properties can be reversibly tuned through the coordination of their open rhodium sites with Lewis bases.

To ensure the required purity (>99%) of acetal 11, we developed a crystallization procedure from cyclohexane/ethylacetate. Other acetalization conditions were unsuccessful, as P-donor substituted benzacetals are highly prone to hydrolysis. Scheme 2: Syntheses of functionalized O-(hydroxymethyl)phenols from 4hydroxybenzaldehyde (16).

O-Labelled aldehyde 15 was unstable towards humidity induced H2 O back-exchange, resulting in loss of labelling efficiency.

    "context": "In the small molecule CRN (Figure ), amine substrates t-Am-1 or t-Am-2 react with DVP to generate an intermediary allylammonium ion (DVP-t-Am-1 or DVP-t-Am-2). After fuel activation, reaction with a thiol (SH-3) forms a waste product (DVP-S) and regenerates the amine substrate, thus completing one cycle. Using sub-stoichiometric amounts of amine (0.2 eq.) with excess fuel (1.0 eq.) we first converted t-Am-1 and t-Am-2 to the activated intermediates (0.2 eq.), which upon SH-3 addition (0.2 eq.) reversed back to the neutral amine.",

    "question": "What are the yields and crystal colors for the synthesized trans-1,2-dimetalloethenes?",
    "answer": "The trans-1,2-dimagnesioethene 2a iPr (thf)4 was obtained as yellowish orange crystals in a 47% yield, while the trans-1,2-dialuminoethene 5a Et (thf)2 was isolated as pale yellow crystals in a 12% yield.",
    "context": "The structures of key dimetalloalkene intermediates 2 and 5 are unambiguously determined by X-ray crystallography (Figure ). A dimagnesioalkene for XRD analysis was synthesized by a reaction of 1a with mineral oil-free sodium lumps in the presence of isopropylmagnesium chloride for a long reaction time of 16 h. After removal of NaCl, recrystallization from toluene provided the corresponding trans-1,2-dimagnesioethene 2a iPr (thf)4 as yellowish orange crystals in 47% yield. According to a similar procedure, trans-1,2-dialuminoethene 5a Et (thf)2 was prepared from diethylaluminium chloride as pale yellow crystals in 12% yield. The verification of the trans stereochemistry of 5 is important to eliminate the possibility of the preferential formation of its cis isomer. X-ray diffraction study on singles crystals of both 2a iPr (thf)4 and 5a Et (thf)2 displayed dimetallic structures where the two metals occupy the trans-positions to each other in the central ethene skeletons. The C1-C1' bonds in the [PhCCPh] unit delivered from diphenylacetylene are elongated to typical C=C double bonds (1.328(6) √Ö for 2a iPr (thf)4 and 1.355(2) √Ö for 5a Et (thf)2) along with formation of comparable C(sp 2 )-metal bonds (C1-Mg in 2a iPr : 2.195(4) √Ö, and C1-Al in 5a Et : 2.005(2) √Ö) with those in the reported 1,2dimagnesioethene 14 and 1,2-dialuminoethenes. Having the isolated 1,2-dimetalloethenes 2a iPr (thf)4 and 5a Et (thf)2 in hand, we resorted to demonstrating reactivity similar to that described in Figure and 3b. 1,2-Dimagnesioethene 2a iPr (thf)4 underwent the copper-catalyzed hydroxyalkylation using isobutylene oxide to afford 4ab in 80% yield (Figure ). 1,2-Dialuminoethene 5a Et (thf)2 reacted with paraformaldehyde to provide 6a in 80% yield (Figure ). Computational investigation of dearomatization. In order to investigate the mechanism of the unique dearomatization of arylacetylenes (Figure and 3b), we carried out DFT calculation using the reaction of 1,2-dialumino-1,2-diphenylethene 5a Me with monomeric formaldehyde in THF solvent as a model reaction (Figure ).",

    "answer": "Geraniin is formed by a reductive reaction from amariin and isoamariin. These precursors can themselves be generated via an oxidative process from an earlier compound through the intermediate terchebin, which contains a 2,4-(R)-DHHDP group.",
    "context": "Conversely, another possible biosynthetic pathway toward 1 C 4 -type ellagitannins exists (Scheme 1b). Geraniin (2) is reductively biosynthesized from amariin (3) and isoamariin (15) In addition, 3 and 15 can be oxidatively biosynthesized from 1 via terchebin (12) bearing a 2,4-(R)-DHHDP group. Although the conformation of 12 has not been investigated, it was suggested to exist in an intermediate state between the B 1,4 and O,3 B (or 1 C 4 ) conformations in DMSO-d 6 . We assume that 12 might also have a flexible conformation; this is currently under investigation. Carpinusin (9) can also be biosynthesized from 12. The formation of a DHHDP group between the 1,6-galloyl groups in 12 would afford unknown intermediates 13 and 14, which could be reductively metabolized to produce 9.",
