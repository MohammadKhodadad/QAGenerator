  "If the NCLS volume were to be increased, with respect to the CLS volume, it could approximate the function of a reference electrode (assuming initial 50% SOC in the NCLS) and reported voltages could be replaced by potentials vs the utilized redox couple. We note that certain RAOMs may have potential-dependent capacity fade rates (such as viologens when accessing the reduced vs doubly reduced species We summarize the statistical variation in temporal capacity fade rates of the aforementioned experiments (where no current-dependent degradation was observed) in Fig. .",
  "The fluorescent line profile indicated that the small microdomains have liquid order but include a small amount of pm-AuNRs. The main fluorescent intensities were those of Rho-PE, and the peak width of the Rho-PE profiles was reasonable judging from the domain size, but the domain NBD-PE fluorescent decrease was not strong compared to the profiles of the Ld phase before phase transition shown in Figure .",
  "Vina scoring function shows deficiencies on flexible-receptor tasks as Vina results in a loss in top-1 success rate when the search is more exhaustive (Table ). Rescoring DSDPFlex was shown in this study to bring in significant improvement. Although calling GNINA for rescoring is a current solution, it falls short in speed (∼7/8 of the runtime is consumed by rescoring). Towards further development, we will need to develop and implement a fast rescoring phase in the program.",
  "Our group and others have recently exploited a reductive route to generating the key cobalt hydride which performs hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). This proceeds via sequential single electron reduction of Co(II) to Co(I) and subsequent protonation. We recognised that thisin contrast to traditionally used oxidative conditions might enable us to also reduce ketone coupling partners under the same conditions to their corresponding radical anion. Following HAT to a diene to generate an allylic radical, radical-radical coupling via the persistent radical effect could then occur, bypassing the unproductive Ocentred radical that was problematic in previous approaches (Scheme 1d).",
  "PC loadings plot indicated that ~70% of the variance was attributed to sharp peaks at 2920 cm - 1 and 2845 cm -1 and broad bands centred around 1370, 1250, 1050 cm -1 (Figure ). This conferred measurable leeching of cadaveric fluids into burial soil and the impact of varying fabric on CDI progression. analogues not only in forensic sciences but also medical and biological research due to their similar physiology, cellular properties, anatomy, and microbiome . Their cost and size and subsequent faster decomposition allows for larger replicate cohorts and greater robustness.",
  "Before employing GFN2-xTB in subsequent QM/MM simulations, we evaluated its ability to model the chemistry of HAA by reoptimizing the DFT cluster model structures with GFN2-xTB in implicit chloroform (Fig. ). All reactant and product structures exhibited only real frequencies, while the transition states displayed a single large imaginary frequency with all others being real. The imaginary normal mode corresponded to hydrogen atom abstraction from C 9 by the oxo group on Fe B for both intermediates, confirming the method's ability to capture the essential reaction mechanism.",
  "In FeatureDock, we utilize the L-BFGS-B optimization algorithm to find the ligand pose that best fits to the predicted probability density envelope, and we acknowledge that this optimization process could be trapped into local energy minima. To address this issue, we perform independent optimization runs initiated from different compound rotamers and using different random seeds.",
  "For organic molecules, we observed excellent agreement between MD results obtained using MACE and SO3krates MLFFs when trained on comprehensive datasets. Discrepancies were primarily in the transition regions between (meta)stable states or large atomic fluctuations, likely due to the completeness of the training dataset rather than the ML architecture itself. The sGDML model also performed acceptably for the smaller peptide, proving reliable MDs trajectories. In contrast, the other two kernel-based ML models, SOAP/GAP and FCHL19*, exhibited insufficient stability, rendering them unsuitable for extended MD simulations.",
  "In conclusion, the widely employed strategy of augmenting docking scores with additional parameters to steer molecular generation towards a desired region of chemical space proved inefficient in this context, likely due to the need for fine-tuning the augmented objective function. A more effective approach was direct control over the composition of starting fragments and the fragments used during molecule growth. . Top scored generated compounds across three independent runs for each combination of settings. Compounds bind to the hinge region and have the fraction of sp 3 carbon atoms in scaffolds equal or greater than 0.3.",

  "Selection and optimization of the structures for BIE and SAPT calculations. After classical MM MD simulations, 1 ns of QM/MM MD simulations at PM3 29 /MM level were performed with the QM part consisting of all atoms of the ligands. Finally, ten snapshots of each complex were extracted from the QM/MM simulations based on minimal total distance between the leaving group and residues stabilizing it (N38 and W109 in LinB, N41 and W107 in DhaA). Calculation of selected distances were performed using the CPPTRAJ module 30 implemented in AMBER.",
  "Three rod-like inclusions and five disk-like inclusions were considered, as shown in Figures and. Inclusions were built on an ideal Ag fcc lattice, but allowed to optimize in the CPMD simula- tion. The matrix extended 2 Mg-O layers beyond the edge of the inclusion in each direction. This kept the cell from conducting into its periodic image while keeping control of loading and cell size, and ensuring appropriate lattice continuation at boundaries.",

  "The energy minimization was run with steepest descent method instead of using MD simulation in order to change the protein coordinates in such a way as to reduce the potential energy. The energy minimized model was opened with word pad in order to remove the spdbv coordinates it put during energy minimization run of steepest method with 10.000Å cutoff. The spdbv coordinates removed energy minimized is the final refined model for further studies.",

  "It is especially the independence of the basis sets of the Wiberg values emerging Table that makes the strongest contrast with the Mayer values. As seen there, the Mayer values computed with aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets are completely at odds with elementary chemistry. We chose aug-cc-pVTZ to illustrate the disastrous impact of employing basis sets augmented with diffuse functions on the Mayer values. Still, we showed 40 that employing augmented basis sets in studies on carbon chain anions of astrophysical interest is mandatory. E.g., calculations without properly including diffuse functions fail to correctly predict both the structure and spin multiplicity of the C 4 N -anion. Table I is just one example that Mayer valence and bond order indices are completely unacceptable for carbon chains. The Mayer bond order indices for the non-problematic triacetylene HC 6 H molecule (Table ), for the pentadiynylidene HC 5 H diradical (Table ) as well as the Mayer valencies included in other tables presented below convey the same message.",

  "A Docker image of AutoDock VinaGPU was used, running on commercial RTX4070 or RTX3070 GPUs. For each protein, the corresponding KLIFS structures with predefined binding site boxes were iterated and all compounds with known activities docked. The AutoDock VinaGPU implementation differs slightly from the well characterized CPU version in its docking settings, where the exhaustiveness parameter is now replaced by search_depth and thread. A small parameter optimisation was performed to benchmark the performance of VinaGPU on this dataset, resulting in the final settings search_depth = 10, threads = 8192 which resulted in balanced performance vs. run time (data not shown). Output .pdbqt formatted poses were converted to .mol format using OpenBabel and aggregated in a tabular format for inclusion in the database.",
  "Our lab (and others) are exploring much-needed benchmarks of one-electron basis set and density functional on enzyme models. To avoid model construction contributing to kinetic and thermodynamic errors, the current study demonstrates that QM-cluster models require, at minimum, over ∼150 atoms. This lower bound to model size unfortunately guarantees that employing large basis sets and double-hybrid density functionals will be intractable for most production-level exploration of enzyme chemical mechanisms.",
  "Space charge effects are a major limiter of mass analyzer dynamic range. In Orbitrap™ analyzers , a widely used form of electrostatic trap for example, a high overall number of injected ions raises the average potential within the device, reducing the ion oscillation frequency and causing a (largely correctable) ~+1 ppm m/z measurement shift across all peaks per ~10 5 charges. Coupling of oscillation frequencies between ions of like, or merely similar m/z then generates less intuitive resonant effects such as self-bunching and coalescence at ~10 4 charges in-peak .",

  "These shifts make several interatomic distances differ from WT by about 1 Å, in addition to the F266 ring rotation, with its effect on H + -π interaction; these are shown in Fig. . None of the side chain changes is individually large, but collectively they can easily account for a difference of several kBT in energy. One expects that a loss of gating charge would accompany disruption of this system, although this calculation cannot directly show that. Standard models would make an opposite prediction; the removal of the -OH should make sliding S4 easier, producing a left shift. Y266 ionization in WT is the only apparent explanation for the effect of the Y266F mutation.",
  "Standard protein residues were simulated with AMBER ff14SB . The protein was solvated with 10 Å of TIP3P water buffer in a periodic rectangular prism box and neutralized with Na + counterions.

  "This work demonstrates how a library of UAAs can be easily constructed in two stages from inexpensive aspartate and glutamate-based RAE precursors: parallel screening on small scale using a commercial potentiostat followed by preparative scale reactions. Even though no substantial attempts were made to optimize individual reactions beyond the originally published conditions, yields for these onestep processes are reasonable given the rapid access to UAAs that is enabled for exploratory studies.",
  "The GS is stabilized in a more polar solvent environment, which leads to an increased energy of the electronic transition.

Both double-well potentials have a very shallow depth of ∼ 7×10 -3 meV per atom and lead to a stable Cc structure with 176 atoms per cell (ζ-Bi 2 Sn 2 O 7 ; Figure ). This indicates that the β phase is likely a thermal average of equivalent lower-symmetry ζ structures.",
  "Since halides are versatile functional groups in organic synthesis, we further showcased the synthetic applications of this procedure to prepare compounds with other important functional groups. As shown in Fig. , several transformations of some chlorides produced from natural products or drug sources were conducted.

  "Design Priorities: Since internal conversion (IC) is the ratelimiting step in non-radiative decay (Fig ), designs for fast IC may be key to rationally improving PA dyes. Recent designs applied asymmetry induced vibronic coupling (NR735), excited state geometry changes (PA-HD), or conical intersections of molecular switches (azohemicyanines), onto known NIR fluorophores (Fig ; see also Supporting Note 1). Yet, even these few PA dyes designed for rational knr minimisation were still built from established NIR fluorophores, by later introducing motifs to suppress ΦFL. This seems to be the wrong priority order for optimising PA signal! Here, we wished to break from the usual NIR-fluorophore-based design space: instead jumping to a new chemical space of scaffolds that lock in the picosecond knr photophysics which we hypothesise as key for PA, and leave NIR/SWIR absorption for later steps of design tuning.",

  "To ensure that the ground state electron configurations of transition metals in the guest complexes were closed-shell singlets, we optimized structures in implicit solvent using restricted DFT in singlet states or unrestricted DFT in triplet and quintet states and compared the electronic energies. For the unrestricted calculations, we used level-shifting of 0.25 hartree on the majorityand minority-spin orbitals, and no significant spin contamination was observed with all complexes having〈S 2 〉that deviated from the expected S(S + 1) value by less than 1.0. Because the energetic difference between spin states may be sensitive to the amount of Hartree-Fock exchange as well as functional family or basis set choice, we excluded any guest complexes with singlet-triplet spin splitting energies less than 20 kcal/mol when evaluated with B3LYP-D3(BJ)/LACVP* upon optimization in C-PCM water implicit solvent.

This approach does well for a minimal basis but struggles for bigger bases compared with using atomic valence active space (AVAS) . AVAS uses minimal basis-like orbitals projected onto the basis of the calculation for orbital selection without invoking any ML techniques. Despite its success, it defaults to selecting all the orbitals in a minimal basis, and the CAS space size of the benzene mentioned above still holds unless configured manually and carefully.",

  "The terminology µGTM is used to highlight that the input CLS vectors are themselves originating from standard chemical space GTM. As already mentioned, a GA was used to search an optimal parameter set producing a µ-map that will optimally visualize the CLS. This, of course, implies a quantitative definition of \"optimality\" -a CLS map fitness score. Typically, the fitness of regular CS maps, hosting individual compounds, is related to the propensity of the map to regroup molecules of similar properties and avoid co-localization of compounds with different properties: Neighborhood Behavior (NB) compliance. This is possible only based on \"training\" sets of compounds of experimentally known properties. In the CLS context, µ-mapped items are libraries and there are no properties measured to globally characterize each library as an object.",

  "HER imposes significant limits on carbon use in LAB. The low hydrogen evolution overpotential of the carbon materials can cause the battery to lose water, followed by device failure, limiting carbon as an additive to NAM . Carbon current collectors always have some proprietary preparation or just have a lead coating to avoid HER . Carbon EDLC also needs some means to inhibit HER without reducing capacitance properties. For these reasons, many studies for carbon surface modification to inhibit HER have appeared in the literature in recent years. Prominent methods are the introduction of nitrogen heteroatoms in a pyrrolic structure , lead particles deposition , and the polyaniline (PAni) deposition .",

  "To study the initial TrxR reduction rate more cleanly, without such convoluted balances of probe re-oxidation vs cyclisation, we turned next to Michaelis Menten kinetic studies. We created new sets of non-fluorogenic selenenyl sulfides as TrxR substrates whose reduction step we could monitor indirectly, by tracking NADPH consumption (Figure ). All the 1,2-thiaselenanes were rather poor substrates for reduction by TrxR, in both the basic amine (N) and PQ-mimicking amide (D) series. However, within each series, the two trends from the fluorogenic probe activation studies were confirmed: monocyclic SeS-substrates are more rapidly reduced than SeSPs (cf. retro rates), and the P piperazinamide greatly accelerated reduction (Figure , Figure ).",

SeSC was easily derivatised further to P-SeSC with succinic anhydride, then TSTU and Nmethyl piperazine. In contrast, access to the 1,3-Se,N regiocontrol SSeC was less direct, since after Bus-deprotection and PQ carbamate installation, the intermediate's Ns group could not be removed without cleavage of the carbamate.

  "The latter aspect proves extremely useful in non-linear optimization of pulse sequences as it may significantly reduce the number of free variables relative to previously demonstrated optimal control type optimizations typically using hundreds to thousands of variables and presenting pulse sequences as lengthy arrays of amplitudes and phases. Such sequences may be difficult to interpret and may practically lead to concerns for the instrumentalists, as they do not leave much room for instrumental optimization and ready adaption to transfer via couplings with different size. While used mostly in relation to NMR and MRI experiment, op- timal control theory has also been applied in the context of developing DNP experiments theoretically and numerically. We will in the following demonstrate numerical and experimental results based on a simpler approach facilitated by the simplicity offered by the SSV-EHT FOM formulation appropriately balancing linear and bilinear terms in the effective Hamiltonian, and employing non-linear optimization. More specifically, a controlled random search followed by optimization using the subplex routine -a variant nonlinear Nelder-Mead simplex optimization with subspace search.",

  "Nevertheless, while re-accessing the LNO plateau at 4.2 V (corresponding to 40 mAh.g -1 ) slows down the capacity fading, the irreversibility of the H2H3 phase transition ascribed to this redox plateau prematurely fatigues the LNO electrode over prolonged cycling and precipitates the capacity fading at a later stage . Finally, stabilization cannot be solely due to a raise of negative potential and likely implies other mechanisms such as the gradual stabilization of the SEI. In definitive, consequences of graphite staging jump on capacity retention plot can vary depending on the stability of the positive material and/or the electrolyte at high potential. Only the implementation of a complete analysis workflow can avoid misinterpretations of knee points in capacity fading curves which is all the more complex, and a sole electrochemical analysis can only highlight one prevailing degradation while missing the rooting cause for the rollover, as demonstrated in this perspective.",

These geometries correspond to the reaction paths for the 6298 elementary processes explored with the AFIR method.

  "In parallel, we conducted a molecular dynamics simulation for protein-ligand complexes. Leishmania major proteins were used as models of Leishmania sp. proteins. Homology protein for lmDHFR was constructed utilising the web-server . For lmPTR1 and hDHFR, proteins were taken from the protein databank (1WOC and 1KMS codes respectively). The initial input was taken from previous docking studies already published. Complexes protein-ligand and NADP were generated by using the tleap module implemented in Ambertools18. Complexes were subjected to a protocol of minimisation and equilibration with Sander implemented in Ambertools18 as well.

  "In conclusion, we report the synthesis and isolation of a stable genuine bismuthinidene (2) featuring a single C(sp 2 )-Bi bond and a fascinating electronic structure. The low-coordination number of the Bi center leaves two electrons in two nearly degenerate p-orbitals, thus resulting in a triple ground state. In addition, the intrinsically large SOC constant of Bi dramatically stabilizes the MS=0 sublevel, leading to an apparent diamagnet. These properties combined result in a unique electronic situation for a main group compound, opening up new unchartered territories.",
  "The computational study was based on AIMD simulations with the CP2K software package using the B3LYP functional with Grimme's dispersion correction (D3), GTH pseudopotentials, the DVZP-MOLOPT-SR basis set with a density cutoff of 400 Ry, and the Auxiliary Density Matrix Method (ADMM) for Hartree-Fock Exchange Calculations using the cFIT3 auxiliary basis and a cutoff radius of 4.95 Å. The electronic response for the computation of VCD was obtained with projected periodic NVPT calculations using the BLYP functional, MT pseudopotentials, and a plane wave cutoff of 100 Ry based on our own development version of the CPMD code, available on GitHub. The local response observables were obtained based on maximally localised Wannier functions (MLWFs) that were calculated from the electronic structure. In this procedure, the Wannier centres are mapped to their corresponding molecular centre of mass via their nearest heavy atom, and their magnetic gauge is shifted accordingly. This defines the units used in the fragmentation approach in Equation . Further details of the simulation procedure can be found elsewhere for compounds 1 52 and 2 .",

  "However, the previous study employed around 10 explatory variables that are obtained from standard DFT calculations. Therefore, its interpretation was not straightforward. In a clear contrast, our current work revealed that Sconf and Rmonomer played a dominant role in the prediction of emulsion RIGP reactivity. In a chemically interpretable fashion, the \"monomer rigidity\" or \"steric hinderance\" were decisive for the RIGP chemistry. As such, CREST based computatiaons should provide an indispensable insght into the complex reactions system, and the its combination with mahine learning algolisms should foster the understanding and prediction of material sciences that are usually difficult to understand in a chemically and physically interpretable fashion.",

  "The analysis of conformational ensembles for HL1CON indicated it has generally more IMHBs, lower PSA and lower Rgyr than HL1 in both chloroform and DMSO solutions (SI Sec-tion_15 & Section_16). We also noticed that HL1CON showed more rOe between its JQ1 and VH032 warheads in relatively polar DMSO solution, suggesting it might suffer from hydrophobic collapse likewise in aqueous solution. This was tested by further conformational sampling and DFT minimisations in Hence, we hypothesize that strong lipophilic collapse should negatively influences PROTAC cell permeability, and it does not appear to support 'chameleonicity' theory whereby the ability to adopt multiple conformations would be expected to allow both membrane penetration and aqueous solubility. Instead, for HL1CON as the example in this study, its intensive self-collapse does not drive such molecule to get into waterphase or leave membrane, which was indicated by the lowrecovery ratios from bi-directional caco-2 assay (Table ). a.",

Performance benchmarking efforts focused on the solvent removal presented alongside the CSD MOF subset , and CoRE 2019 MOF database due to their popularity in HT screenings. Structure error flagging achieved using the MOSAEC workflow directed the selection of specific crystal structures requiring investigation. Efforts concentrated on cases where the compared solvent removal routines produced disparate results in terms of structural validity; in other words, where the automated oxidation state and structure checking process concluded that one dataset produced a satisfactory chemical structure while the other possessed some form of structural error (e.g., removal of integral charge-balancing ligands, omitted hydrogens, disorder, etc.).

All calculations in this article that involve DFT (and TD-DFT) were performed in ORCA 5.0.4 using its default RIJCOSX approximations.

  "Another oligoamide, foldamer (S )-2 (Figure ), emphasizes the importance of the shortrange interactions in determining twist sense. In this case, hydrogen bonding to the ethereal oxygen of the (1S )-camphanyl group further restricts the free rotation about the C*-C(O) bond, simplifying the analysis as the twist sense is effectively the only conformational degree of freedom. A model analogous to that in Figure predicts that the P helix should be preferred, as is observed. Notably, the d.e.

The AutoTST calculated rate agrees much more favorably (∆ log 10 k of 2.1 at 1000 K) with their high pressure limit rate expression. This serves as a reminder that AutoTST provides only high-pressure limit rates of elementary reactions, which should be used as input to a pressure-dependent Master Equation solver (such as Arkane, included with RMG) for fall-off, chemically activated, and multi-well systems.",
  "Lead optimization remains a substantial computational challenge for modern computational chemistry. Computationally intensive campaigns, such as molecular dynamics for relative binding free energy simulations are typically severely limited by availability of computational resources as well as difficulty in implementing computations in a high-through put manner.

  "The second regime is similar to the ν-DABNA:mCBPCN film DF, where efficient FRET occurs, and the last regime is an extension of the DF tail which comes from the slow upconversion of unfavourable species in the inhomogeneous DMAC-TRZ system (less twisted conformers with slow krISC). The average DF lifetime is 11 μs (Table ), indicating that these slow species greatly increase the overall DF lifetime of the hyperfluorescent system, an undesirable phenomenon in OLEDs. showing how a very small spectral overlap can still give rise to fast and efficient energy transfer between them. FRET is relatively slow because the sensitiser (singlet CT state) transition dipole moment is very small.

  "We hope that the various analytical formulas for the tunneling current reported here will assist experimentalists to adequately process transport data measured at nonvanishing (room) temperature and to more properly assign the transport mechanism at work in a specific molecular junction. Letting alone the aspect of elegance, the present analytical formulas have an important practical advantage over the often utilized brute force method of numerically integrating eqn (4) using a uniform energy grid. To resolve both the thermal smearing of the Fermi distributions and the variation of transmission with energy, a sufficiently fine uniform energy grid requires an energy step size δ ε ≈ min (k B T, Λ) /10. In an energy range ∆ε ∼ 10 eV this easily translates into a grid with N ∼ 10 4 -10 6 points, which may make data fitting time consuming in some cases.",

  "Since this bicyclic substructure was ultimately not required for myrioneurinol (2), we sought to alleviate this steric issue by cleaving the bridging system prior to alkene hydrogenation (Scheme 2). The first step in such a plan, acetonide deprotection of 19, proved to be unexpectedly challenging as standard acidic conditions led to decomposition or an undetermined rearranged product. After screening a variety of conditions, a mild cerium trichloride/oxalic acid system was discovered to provide a tractable solution delivering diol 21 in 65% yield along with some recovered 19 (18%).

  "The almost identical performance of both catalysts is somewhat unexpected: the CF3-modified XB donor 2 CF3 -I/OTf features hindered rotation around the C-N bonds connecting the benzimidazolium groups to the core, and thus syn and anti atropisomers can be isolated. The syn isomer used herein is highly preorganized and is typically more active than freely rotating variant 2 H -I/OTf. A drawback of the former catalyst, however, is the somewhat tedious separation of the atropisomers.",
  "With optimized TrEnDi conditions established for permethylation of GLUF and MPPA in standards, the derivatization chemistry was further tested using a herbicide solution, representing a more complex sample matrix. A stock solution of Liberty ® 200 SN herbicide was created and diluted prior to TrEnDi, as described above. TrEnDi successfully formed [GLUF Tr ] + in the herbicide mixture with no unmodified or undermethylated products identified. LC-MRM chromatograms of unmodified and modified GLUF in Liberty ® were acquired in chemical triplicate and overlayed (Figure ).",

  "Compound 2 demonstrated stable but less dynamic interactions, characterized by moderate binding free energy and minimal secondary structure evolution. While its interactions sustained protein compactness, further structural refinements-like improving its hydrophobic interactions or introducing additional hydrogen bonding groups-could enhance its specificity and binding strength within the active site of CFIXa. In contrast, compound 3 exhibited significant instability, with notable RMSD fluctuations and weak binding affinity, ultimately resulting in unbinding during the simulation.",

  "Synthesizing PAH with rings larger than six atoms is a challenge affecting Schwarzites as well. Octagon-tiled Schwarzites are highly symmetrical and balanced, while heptagon is not an easy-to-fit tile for the cubic symmetry possessed by most TPMS. Application of dimers and condensed trimers (type 3, Fig. ) not only satisfies symmetry, but also solves the problem of unpaired p-orbitals in the allsp 2 heptagon hydrocarbon. For two other types of trimers, one or three carbon atoms with unpaired p-orbitals must be temporarily replaced by sp 3 atoms during the synthesis. Scheme 2.

The mesolytic cleavage of benzylic bonds 11c,29 is a useful alternative to catalytic hydrogenation for elaborate substrates with poisoning functionalities. The reaction is reported combining a photoexcited anion with a hydrogen-atom donor. We tested benzyl-protected species without additives (Figure ).

The opposite was the case for alkynes bearing electron-withdrawing substituents such as ester, ketone, and CF3 groups. An enyne could also be transformed into dienamide 4qa in 65% yield under conditions A. Note that terminal alkynes failed to give the iodo(III)amidation product under the present conditions.",

Bench-stable complexes such as 1 can be prepared in a single step from commercially available starting materials, namely HPR2 and Mn2(CO)10 (Scheme 1 and TOC graphic). This allows simple gram-scale access to potentially exciting catalyst diversity. Together, these attributes motivated us to explore dinuclear Mn2H systems for catalytic applications and uncover novel reactivity and coordination chemistry.",

  "Excimers were first observed in mercury 8 and helium that the strong excimer absorption can indeed be assigned to this transition-a small distortion lowering symmetry from D 6h to D 2h splits the optically forbidden E 1u state into a dark and a bright components, with the bright component being polarized along the inter-fragment axis. In the DMO-LCFMO framework, this transition is similar to the σ(2s) → σ * (2s) transition in helium dimer (Fig. ).

  "By modeling energy-hindered bulk inversion based on replacing small highly charged cations with much larger mono-positive ions, we elaborated an efficient strategy for converting binary metal chalcogenides into ternary ones, using Sb III -to-Ag I exchange as a control within Sb2X3 (X= S, Se). Reference experiments, theoretical simulations, and multiple data analyses of solid and liquid phases of cation exchange systems confirmed that introducing anion vacancies and AgMeVSe(S) complex defects could facilitate a certain amount of energy-unfavored cation exchange reactions on TF scales. Concurrently, supportive agents within various Lewis acidity can affect the reaction yield on substrates, approaching 90% of the theoretical capacity to insert Ag atoms into defect-activated TF frameworks of Sb2X3 and inverting top layers into AgSbX2 when cation exchange systems are rationalized to AgNO3: NaCl: SbCl3 composition. The presented strategy opens up a new synthetic dimension that is unattainable for common routes to initiate the defect-mediated functionalization and transformation of bulk materials with acceptable yield accuracy. Moreover, obtained structures with aliovalent cation substitution possess a potential for optoelectronic applications; in particular, samples most heavily inverted into AgSbSe2 exhibited substantial antibacterial activity within a short span in visible light.",

  "Next, we added just Na + , an ion not considered a cofactor of OmpLA. The rationale for these controls was that if lipid curvature effects activate OmpLA, other ions affecting c 0 should yield similar protein activities.

  "2+ is determined by both paramagnetic (σPARA) and spin-orbit coupling contributions (σSO) (Figure ). Prominently, σPARA become larger for the model of amines terminated nonpolar facet compared with core Cd, because one coordinated Se of Cd was replaced by N. While the corresponding σSO decreased, explaining why their δiso are similar even if Cd adopted different coordination. For the model of amine terminated Se-rich facet, its increased σPARA and σSO lead to δiso shifted upfield.",

An energy cutoff of 450 eV is used for plane-wave basis expansion in all the calculations. For the formation energies of metal oxides and their defects, GGA (Generalized Gradient Approximation) is often inaccurate, thus the hybrid functional proposed by Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE06) is employed in combination with an improved GGA exchange correlation functional PBEsol , using the projector augmented wave (PAW) method.

  "on designability, but unexpected reaction outcomes are crucial in exploring new structures and functionalities. By combining \"incompatible\" building blocks, we employed geometric frustration in reticular materials leading to emergent structural features. The combination of a pseudo C5 symmetrical organic building unit based on a pyrrole core, with a C4 symmetrical copper paddlewheel synthon led to three distinct frameworks by tuning the synthetic conditions. The frameworks show structural features typical for geometric frustration: self-limiting assembly, internally stressed equilibrium structures and topological defects in the equilibrium structure, which manifested in the formation of a hydrogen bonded framework, distorted and broken secondary building units and dangling functional groups, respectively. The influence of geometric frustration on the CO2 sorption behavior and the discovery of a new secondary building unit shows geometric frustration can serve as a strategy to obtain highly complex porous frameworks.",

  "After screening many acidic systems, we found that Lewis acids were superior to Brønsted acid promoters, with generally a stoichiometric amount and heating being required to reach high conversion (Table , entries 1-7; see SI for full details). BF3•OEt2 emerged as the most effective Lewis acid, since this minimized the formation of de-Boc material 35, though this had to be balanced with complicating decomposition of the product with prolonged reaction times. Ultimately, subjection to substoichiometric BF3•OEt2 (0.5 equiv) in DCE at 70 °C gave rapid conversion (20 min) to the desired spirocycle 36 in 58% NMR yield (entry 9). We found these conditions to translate reasonably well on preparative scale (albeit with higher BF3•OEt2 loading), affording 36 in 54% isolated yield, a result we deemed acceptable given the strained nature of the fused sp 2 -rich cyclopentane being constructed.",

Thus, we infer that multiple alternative relaxation pathways for A-U and A-T coexist, possibly making detection of the EDPT process more difficult in the examined systems. The latter process, even though apparently inaccessible from the lowest-lying bright state, could in principle occur after direct population of the CT state by the UV-C pulse.",

  "Relaxed scans were performed at CASSCF level; however, the topography of the PES was characterized by a barrier imposed by a transition state (TS) formed by an avoided crossing between the ground and an excited state. This barrier disappears as dynamic electron correlation is added (Figure in Supp. Information). Given that the calculations of k(T) depend on the normal modes along the reaction path, the CASSCF frequencies do not properly represent the shape of the PES. Since numerical NEVPT2 optimizations are computationally prohibited, we adopted the strategy of combining DFT values of Gcorr(T) with NEVPT2 electronic energies in order to locate the variational TS.

To ensure consistency with the Transition1x dataset, these 131 reactions were re-calculated at ωB97X/6-31G* level.

  "In summary, we have firstly validated the general concept for designing ultra-long CP-RTP and stable chiral diradicals via synchronous implantation of HLCT in P,N-doping BINAPs. These tunable D-A emitters not only endow controllable HLCT excited states to optimize the intersystem crossing but also the chiral environment, facilitating the solvatochromic CPL and ultra-long CP-RTP. Their triplet decay speed and channel highly depend on the ICT strength, which could be adjusted by altering the donors, together with associated variable valency on the Patom. Moreover, the TPA diradicals are isolated by a chiral binaphthyl bridge, which endows the high diradical character and NIR optical activity because of high structural stability. Given the diversity of BNIAPs and other phosphine ligand skeletons, we believe this P,N-synergetic strategy would provide new candidates for the development of efficient CPL emitters, and chiral-driven spin materials from chiral phosphines and their oxides.",

The results showed the negative belt around the halogen atom (\"side-on\" position) usually observed when bonded to electron-withdrawing groups of medium strength, could disappear if bonded to a strong electron-withdrawing group like CN (like NCBr), prohibiting the \"side-on\" Pd-X interaction and the subsequent 3-centered concerted pathway.

That is, a full assembly-disassembly cycle is feasible upon just 450 nm irradiation. Reverting back to both light activation and deactivation, the full CRN was followed by bright field microscopy (Figure , Video 1 and Fig. for comparable 1 H NMR experiments). For these experiments we increased the concentration of SachOL from 5 mM to 10 mM and reduced [Cp*Rh(Bpy)(H2O)] 2+ load to 15% to obtain sufficiently large SachCHO fibers for optical microscopy, as well as to exert photocontrol over the deactivation reaction (note the critical gel concentration of SachCHO is 21 mM for heating/cooling, but at lower concentrations fibers still form).",

Extensions of the original theory of polarization dynamics to complex medium relaxation were developed. Still, the formalism for the coupled Stokes-shift and donor-acceptor distance dynamics proposed to describe electrochemical data was formulated assuming single-exponential relaxation of both coordinates. Given complex dynamics for both nuclear modes reported by simulations, the original model requires an extension. The goal of this article is to extend the previous formulation to complex medium dynamics and to account for the nonergodic cutoff of the relaxation spectrum by the time of electron transfer for fast reactions of primary charge separation in photosynthetic reaction centers. We thus ask the question of whether a distinction between rate's distance dependences is warranted between fast and slow reactions (Fig. ).",

  "The ternary stannide-bismuthide phase Na13Sn26Bi which is somewhat structurally related to the binary germanide Na1-xGe3+z since both are characterized by opened framework of tetrelide elements, demonstrated that it is possible to stabilize novel tetrelide opened frameworks by addition of a heteroatom (here Bi) at very low level. In the title phase, the chemical integrity of the Sn framework is almost preserved as the degree of Sn/Bi mixedoccupancy is quite low, almost at doping level. Its opened framework contains one-dimensional pores larger than 6 Å in diameter that hold the sodium counterions or the weakly bonded Bi atoms. The interactions within the extended Sn framework involved strong localized covalent bonds, while those between Sn and the hetero atom Bi in the channel involved weaker multicenter bond.

  "The catalytic activity of a particular PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloy should then be given by the abundance of the most active configuration. Fig. shows the mean number of sampled number of Pt identified a surface reconstruction of Pt-modified Ru(0001) electrodes at potentials above 0.90 V , resulting in 3D cluster formation with increasing clean Ru areas at Pt concentrations lower than 0.29. However, as these changes are induced by changes in the electrode potential, their description would require a grand-canonical approach taking the electrochemical environment into account , but they are not captured by our kMC simulations.",

  "In conclusion, our combined use of SE measurements and DFT calculations resolved longstanding debates regarding the origins of the key optical signatures of Ti 3 C 2 T x MXenes. We established that the near-IR absorption peak (∼1.5 eV) arises from IBT between nearly flat band states near the Γ point, associated with oxygen ( O) surface terminations, rather than the previously suggested LSPR. This peak is significantly attenuated and is barely measurable in Ti 3 C 2 Cl 2 , which might contain minimal oxygen due to surface adsorption or edge oxidation.",

The latter dataset comprises engineered internal ionizable residues with highly shifted pKa values which are usually harder to predict computationally. To assess the performance of our models rigorously, we test our models and report their performances on large test sets, each of which comprises more than 200 residues with diverse residue types, burial extent, and proteins.",

  "The crystal structure of TEAD in complex with compound 1 (Figure ) was downloaded from the Protein Data Bank 47 using PDB accession code 8A0V (2.70 Å resolution). Missing amino acid side chains and loops in the receptor were built using Prime within Protein Preparation Wizard in Schrödinger Maestro. Following that, hydrogen bonding network was optimized and the model system was visually inspected before performing restrained energy minimization. Key structural waters were kept during the protein preparation setup. Prior to performing molecular dynamics and binding free energy simulations, the compounds were docked to the receptor using Glide program from Schrodinger package. The docking calculations were performed with standard precision. A default van der Waals ligand atom scaling factor of 0.80 was used for atoms with a partial atomic charge (absolute value) less than 0.15, with no scaling for other atoms. Following ligand docking, the top ranked conformer and best pose for each compound was selected for extensive MD and free energy simulations.",

While many bioactive eudesmanoids feature the cis-decalin core, their synthesis entails significant challenges due to the scaffold diversity. Therefore, it was intriguing to investigate the reactivity pattern for the ) in 99% yield.

  "This complete view including protein flexibility, and competition between environments and (hidden) protein pockets can only be properly estimated in the MD simulations as they consider all of these effects. Additional redocking calculations (starting from relaxed configurations from the simulations) performed now in P2, P9 and P11, did not provide new evidence for the preference for P9 in relation to the other pockets (Figure , Table ). However, future experimental evidence is still necessary to confirm the binding pocket and provide the complete molecular mechanism involved in the inhibition of the ECF transporters promoted by our newly discovered compounds.",
  "A 15.4-meter safety buffer is established around the equipment groups, defining a buffered hull that represents infeasible regions (areas where sensor installation is prohibited). Additional operatorprovided information is incorporated to account for other operational restrictions when defining infeasible regions. Examples of such operational restrictions could be inside-facility driving paths and areas preserved for future equipment installation or other purposes. The feasible region is further refined by removing search grid nodes that fall within the infeasible region.",
  "For reaction barriers, the FEs and DEs of common DFAs tended to be negative, but DE(DFA@HF) was typically positive and of much larger magnitude than DE(DFA). This suggested that the overly-local HF density produces a density over-correction for the barrier heights. A careful analysis of charge transfer errors in transition states showed that SCAN and HF made spurious charge transfers of similar magnitude but of opposite sign.",

  "Altogether, the tabulated values, especially regional volumes, paint a concise and chemically relevant picture of formaldehyde's response to an electric field. From these results we conclude that a primary indicator of carbonyl activation is field induced curvature polarization, distinguished by increased negative curvature of the trough delineating the C=O bond and particularly so in the molecular plane. This increased curvature is offset-as required by geometric principles-by an increase in corner character centered on the O lone pair regions.",
  "In the current study, a focused list of fourteen laulimalides marine-containing macrolides (scheme 1) were in-silico investigated against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, aiming to evaluate their binding energies and binding mode to the active site of Mpro. As previously reported, the 100 ns MDS of the Apo-Mpro was enough to equilibrate the protein system at the NVT ensemble (Alaa M. .

Long-range corrected functionals provide a better description of the delocalization in -conjugated molecules, whereas the functionals with low percentage of HF exchange tends to exaggerate the electron delocalization. OS structures were optimized using broken-symmetry approximation with the spin-unrestricted ULC-PBE-D3BJ/def2-TZVPP level of theory, as implemented in Gaussian 16 (rev. A03).

  "First promising instances of enantioselective applications emerged by the groups of Tan 17 and Arai 18 . However, these examples involve XB as one interaction beside several other noncovalent interactions or by the introduction of Lewis/Brønsted-basic moieties to provide a more rigid chiral environment. In 2020, Huber and coworkers introduced novel bidentate chiral bis(imidazolium)-based iodine (I) halogen bond donors as the first example where the enantioinduction was solely reliant on XB (Scheme 1, A).

  "In addition to the general prerequisites for on-board storage of liquid (and potentially also for protecting dry / lyophilized) reagents, such valves need to meet further specifications. During logistics and manual handling, acceleration due to shaking and terrestrial gravity act on the liquid volumes, while the meniscus between the immiscible fluids needs to stay near its default rest position to avoid premature opening. Furthermore, manufacturing and dispensing precision, evaporation rates, and structural fidelity affect the release mechanism, and potentially enclosed or emerging gas bubbles need to be tolerated. This work first elaborates the operational principles for these rotationally controlled on-board storage and release valving. Then strategic features of the basic layout are introduced, and first motivated in a mostly qualitative manner. Next, key performance indicators (KPIs) are defined as design objectives, which are individually or collectively optimized along the \"digital twin\" derived from the underlying functional model.",
  "For trajectories which undergo pseudorotation like distortion, the frontier molecular orbital accepting an electron in the dissociative MC states at the S 5 optimized geometry is shown in Figure lower panel.

We also performed a series of dynamics with fulvene, varying some of the multiple spawning parameters and complementing the discussion presented in the literature. We saw how the choice of initial condition is related to the different population profiles observed from dynamics with CASSCF and CASPT2 since the initial condition can increase the relevance of specific relaxation pathways.",
  "The different ground-state dielectric environment of the two branches is confirmed by computing relative local fields at key carbonyl probes. With IEDRF embedding, we find the local fields to be in near quantitative agreement with the interpretations of recent vibrational Stark-effect experiments, while the agreement is diminished for electrostatically embedded QM/MM calculations. These results caution against QM/MM calculations with electrostatic embedding alone, because CT states in a rigid, dense protein matrix are mostly stabilized by the fast electronic polarization of the surrounding medium.",

  "With optimal condition established, we next proceeded to probe the scope of the protocol. Firstly, the different substitutional pattern was examined to confirm the steric influence of the system (1-6). As expected, the condition was sensitive toward the steric factors, where the labelling efficiency could be improved by releasing the congestion (5-position at 6). The tests on tetralin, chromane and indane showed increased activity on ortho-sites (7-9). These results were consisted with the van Gemmeren's observation of MPAA/pyridine system's steric sensitivity. However, in our cases, the increased volume at ɑ-position further suppressed the accessibility toward hindered sites, leading the labelling concentrated at spacious positions.",

  "Another method to expand the ion cloud is to reduce the RF amplitude, and reduce the depth of the trapping pseudopotential well. Supplemental Figure shows this influence on MRFA space charge behaviour, whereby a deeper well depth reduced space charge resilience and a shallower depth increased it. The effect was surprisingly close to simply modifying TE1, supporting the hypothesis. There appears a temptation to thus lower RF amplitude and enjoy better space charge behaviour, but in practice a high RF amplitude is generally preferred for trapping efficiency and ion capacity. It may be a worthwhile strategy for isolated ion targeted SIM experiments however, where the total ion number is limited and the ion processor's capacity not heavily utilised.",

  "However, considering the significant barriers (~2 eV) of these two hydrogen production steps, we conclude that the H2 evolution cannot take place on the *O 1ML -Mo2C surface, and thus, the surface *O is not the active site for HER. This challenges previous studies that identified surface *O as the active site solely based on the conventional descriptor ΔGH*~0.",

  "Since g ∝ τ X V 2 , one obtains the rate constant scaling as k ET ∝ τ -1 X indicative of overdamped Kramers' kinetics at a sufficiently large electronic coupling V . The relaxation time τ X is the time of the Stokes-shift dynamics describing relaxation of the donor-acceptor energy gap X(t) viewed as the reaction coordinate for radiationless transitions. The diffusional reaction dynamics for protein-water thermal bath are complex, potentially involving many nuclear degrees of freedom. The most significant nuclear modes affecting the reaction dynamics were identified from the analysis of kinetic data extracted from proteinfilm electrochemistry. These are the energy-gap reaction coordinate X(t) and the donoracceptor distance R(t). With the account of these two nuclear modes, the parameter g in eq 4 is given by the following equation",
  "Both the foreground and background inventories are translated into environmental impacts during the life-cycle impact assessment (LCIA) phase using a characterization method. Our assessment follows the hierarchist perspective, which is based on the cultural theory of scientific agreement and common policy principles, adopting a medium timeframe of 100 years for the environmental impacts. The LCIA methodology of choice is ReCiPe 2016, and of the 17 for HF in these two indicators, we used CML 2001 instead in those cases.",
  "In addition to a large CT stabilization due to electronic polarization, we found that thermal fluctuations of the protein significantly modulated the vertical CT energies, leading to energetic distributions with standard deviations exceeding 0.5 eV.

  "Calculations were performed using Density Functional Theory (DFT) implemented in Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP). The energy of the ground state was obtained with Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation potential. In order to represent core electrons, the projected augmented wave (PAW) potential was used with energy cutoff 500 eV. Ce atoms show strong localization of 4f-states which cannot be treated within pure DFT method. To overcome this, 4f-electrons were additionally described in terms of the Dudarev approach within DFT+U correction with Hubbard parameter U=4.5 eV, which was proposed before . Cubic Fm3 ̅ m crystal structure (225 space group) was used to represent atomic arrangement of fluorite CeO2. For the lattice and optical parameters calculation for the pure CeO2, a unit cell containing 12 atoms (4 Ce and 8 O atoms) was considered.",
  "We showed that differences in the applicability and slopes for global oxo formation vs HAT scaling relationships obtained with a GGA vs a hybrid were due to differences in data set construction and not functional choice. Indeed, we observed global LFERs to be insensitive to HF exchange fraction but also to have too high fitting errors to be useful at any a HF value. Analysis of oxidation-and spin-state dependent LFERs by metal indicated that LS LFER slopes were insensitive to HF exchange, whereas for Fe(II) where both IS and HS LFER slopes could be obtained, IS states were disproportionately sensitive. Thus, applicability of a global LFER to open shell metal centers that has sometimes been observed is likely specific to the range of spin states for the systems studied.",
  "The quantum chemical calculations were performed using ORCA 5.0. Groundand excited state optimizations were performed using the B3LYP functional and the cc-pVDZ basis set. Minimum-energy crossing points between the lowest-energy singlet states were optimized using spin-flip time-dependent density functional theory (SF-TDDFT). The conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM) implicitly modeled solvation effects. RIJCOSX density fitting approximation was utilized to increase the efficiency of the calculations. Vertical excitation energies and potential energy profiles were calculated at the TD-BP86 /CPCM/def2-TZVPD //B3LYP/CPCM/cc-pVDZ level of theory in MeCN.

  "indicated that SAMOSA possessed considerable advantages in the management of charge balancing counterions and ligands. Notably, contemporary charged ligand identification and net framework charge accounting procedures decreased the incidence of structural errors observed in previous investigations, particularly those relating to improper removal of ligands and noncoordinating counterions. Further, this method observed comparable accuracy to the most stringent structure preprocessing techniques while maintaining enough generalizability to expand databases towards much higher quantities of reliable activated crystal structures. Precision of the input experimental crystal structures was determined to be a mitigating factor in structure preprocessing as there does not yet exist a universal solution for crystallographic disorder or the limited resolution of hydrogen atoms by X-ray characterization techniques. While this method is not a cure-all for every common crystal structure error, it provides a solution for numerous categories of error and affords computational researchers a greater degree of confidence in the framework charge and structural fidelity to the original experimental report. Enhanced consistency across the structural databases utilized by HT screening and ML studies becomes increasingly vital to both ensure that the output performance targets are accurate and to guarantee that the performance across diverse studies may be fairly evaluated with respect to standard criterion. We propose that this developing field of research requiring computationally activated experimental crystal structures would benefit markedly from the availability of this upgraded, standard solvent removal protocol that more fairly reflects experimental activation.",

Kmw could not be reliably estimated for all NAFCs, where measurable partitioning was negligibly low (Kmw below detect in the literature dataset) -in these cases Kmw was omitted, and the components modelled by Kow alone. This empirical partitioning estimation was preferred to theoretical modelling (e.g., poly-parameter linear free energy relations, ppLFERs, as applied to ionizable organics ), since exact molecular structures and acid dissociation constants (pKa) were unknown for most components detected (Discussion S2). The assumptions of this empirical approach are that detected ions comprised similar molecular structures as in the reference OSPW, and that isomeric NAFCs partition together similarly.",

  "We use the redox response of Ni and Co cations to gain insight into the incorporation of foreign metal species from the electrolyte. Directly tracking the different Fe sites using electrochemistry is not possible as they do not provide a useful redox signature ; Fe 3+ oxidation occurs at potentials within the OER regime and Fe 3+ reduction occurs at potentials where the NiOxHy and CoOxHy host are electrically insulating. We expect that when foreign cations adsorb on the host they should provide a distinct wave separate from that of the host (if they are redox active), while when incorporated substitutionally in interior sites they will exert an electronic affect manifesting as a shift of the host redox-wave potential. correspond to the cycle number, while the bottom cartoon illustrates schematically the process intentionally without atomic detail that is yet unknown.",
  "At all the discrete path points along all LUP paths within the reaction-path network, energy and gradient calculations were performed with the ωB97X-D functional and Def2-SVP basis set. The Hessian is also computed at path terminals (EQs) and PTs. The Grid=FineGrid option was also employed in the calculations, and solvent effects were considered using the solvation model based on density method. THF was adopted as the solvent in the synthesis of fluoroglycine, Passerini reaction, and Lewis-acid-catalysed ene reaction; water was adopted for the Strecker reaction, Wöhler's urea synthesis, and base-catalysed aldol reaction; and cobalt-catalysed hydroformylation was computed in vacuum.

  "The newly discovered one-pot synthesis is of significant pharmaceutical relevance. Quinazolines indeed are key APIs used to manufacture numerous drugs, from high blood pressure treatments through prevention of neurodegenerative diseases, whose current multistep synthesis suffers from low to moderate yields due to the numerous steps involved. Several other APIs can be successfully synthesized over the SiliaCat catalysts, ideally under flow conditions. In 2016 another industry-academia research groups in France reported the synthesis of functionalized (7-aza)indoles by flow chemistry in which the three steps --iodination of indole in C-3 position, pyrrole nitrogen protection via N-Boc formation, and Sonogashira reaction mediated by SiliaCat DPP-Pd contained in a PTFE tubular reactor --are quickly carried out under flow affording high product yields, limited by-product formation and minimal energy utilization.

  "Recently, Hancock and Goerigk performed a comprehensive benchmarking study of excited-state NCIs for aromatic excimers which was later expanded to test spincomponent scaled (SCS) and spin-opposite scaled (SOS) TD-DHDFAs. It was shown that the smallest errors are achieved by spin-scaled RS double-hybrid methods. An additive groundstate dispersion correction generally reduced the error of TD-DFT methods although was inadequate to fully capture the excitedstate dispersion forces in aromatic excimers. This strongly suggests the need to develop an excited-state dispersion correction.",

  "Arylazoisoxazoles are novel azoheteroarenes that undergo reversible N=N bond photoisomerization with the formation of highly stable cis isomer; some of these compounds such as the parent phenylazoisoxazole 1 exhibit unprecedented solid-liquid phase transition upon photoirradiation. But, most of these photoswitches critically suffer from i) the utilization of UV light for the trans-cis isomerization, and ii) the poor isomerization yields in both directions, which limit their practical use as MOST materials. The PSS of reverse isomerization carrying considerable cis% along with the major trans isomer resists the natural liquid-solid phase transition and therefore, inhibits the release of trapped latent heat.",

  "In conclusion, an interesting tendency in ligand selection was found in a Pd-catalyzed hydrogen-isotope exchange employing the MPAA/pyridine ligand system, which could facilitate the arenes' H/D exchange at metaand parapositions. The increasing steric volume of ɑ-substitution was found to promote the HIE efficiency, and the condition rendered an opposite ligand-selection preference with the alkenylation under the same catalytic system. Competing experiments showed the rate of C-D rebonding could be enhanced with the selection of MPAA, which suppressed the rate of the functionalization. This promotion of background hydrogen translation proved an underlying competition between post C-H activation events, despite the functionalization could be finally achieved by consuming the substrate.",

We shall be refer to this as the 'overlap problem'.",
  "• Use larger context radiuses and/or fragments obtained from more synthetically accessible molecules • For larger radiuses and smaller fragment databases there is no need to make repeated runs, results are highly reproducible • For higher diversity of solutions choose Pareto selection, for more robust runtime -selection based on clustering • Use several protein conformations, if possible • Apply restrictions to protein-ligand interactions, if possible • Augmentation of an objective function works for drug-likeness • Use fragments enriched with sp 3 carbon atoms to generate corresponding molecules, augmentation of the objective function works poorly in this case Analyzing outputs of CReM-dock we noticed that there were many top scored compounds bearing many methyl groups of halogen atoms. Those atoms are mainly added at the later iterations and are unlikely critically important for ligand-protein recognition and binding. However, introduction of these groups can make structures more complex and less synthetically feasible. To overcome this issue, we may suggest to specify the minimum size of the attached fragment greater than 1, which is used by default.",

  "Using our multi-GPU implementation, we have successfully pioneered the ground-state DFT and the excited-state TDDFT calculations for the whole GFP system. We employed the HFLYP exchange-correlation functional, where the exact HF exchange (c X = 1.0) is combined with the Lee-Yang-Parr correlation functional . We note that the hybrid functionals with a lower HF exchange resulted in spurious low-lying charge-transfer states that hampered the excited-state calculations.",
  "Our route to TSA5 began with aspartic acid diester 1, which is cheap or can be readily synthesised from aspartic acid. Bocprotection on a multi-decagram scale gave 2 in 98% yield without further purification after aqueous workup (Figure ). The diester was reduced with excess LiAlH4. In contrast to Raines' established procedure, we took no precautions to exclude air, and used undried 98% THF, yet upon Fieser workup, diol 3 was received in 93% yield and excellent purity without further purification. Smallscale conditions for activating 3 to the di-mesylate 4 are well-established, but again we aimed for a procedure that is practical on a decagram scale. We found conditions to precipitate 4 directly from the organic extracts after aqueous workup, collecting a 69% yield of pure solid 4 by simple filtration (concentration of the filtrate and chromatography can supply an additional 15% yield if desired).",

  "The interaction network of 4b is equivalent to the interactions of sulfonamide 1, apart from the missing oxygen. The remaining sulfinamide oxygen forms the same S=O … HC interactions with Tyr26, Phe36 and Phe99 as observed for 1. The protein did not adapt to the gap created by the removed oxygen atom in vicinity to Tyr82. The missing S=O … HC interactions of said oxygen obviously account for the sulfinamide's lower binding affinity.",

  "All periodic DFT calculations were carried out using the Castep as implemented in the Materials Studio package. Vanderbilttype ultrasoft pseudopotentials and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange correlation were used for all structure calculations. A semi-empirical dispersion correction was included in the calculation to take the van der Waals interactions into account. A cutoff energy of 544 eV and a 2×3×2 k-point mesh (generated using the Monkhorst-Pack scheme) were found to be sufficient for total energy to converge within 0.01 meV atom -1 . The starting structures (sql-1-M-NCS•3CO2) were obtained from the synchrotron PXRD refinement as described above.

  "(1) It operates in the spectral region that the chromophore absorbs, even if the azobenzene is (conveniently) transparent there. For NB dyads, Z→all-E photoswitching is efficient at 540 -680 nm, and extends to 740 nm, even with azobenzenes that typically isomerise only below 530 nm (Fig ). This allows choosing chromophores for any desired wavelength response(s): so permits Z→E-switching that previously required cyan/blue, to now operate in the red/NIR.",
  "Flow cell experiments were constructed with cell hardware from Fuel Cell Tech (Albuquerque, NM). The flow cell was assembled into a zero-gap flow cell configuration using pyrosealed POCO graphite flow plates with identical interdigitated flow fields. Each electrode was composed of 1 layer of AvCarb HCBA carbon cloth with a 5 cm 2 geometric surface area. Selemion DSV-N was used as the anion exchange membrane. The flow rate was set at 50-70 mL/min.

  "The atomic structure of MoS 2 makes the valence of the comprised atoms satisfied. Hence, its surface lacks coordinatively unsaturated sites. This makes the formation of new covalent and ionic bonds typically unfavorable since it would change the chemical bonding structure of the sheet. As a consequence, such interactions are usually exclusive to defected or strained TMDs due to the bonding already being affected. It leaves the interactions with the pristine surfaces of MoS 2 mostly limited to vdW forces unless the adsorbate is able to facilitate a dative bond .",

  "Considering higher monomer concentrations favor nucleation overgrowth, steric hindrance restricting growth should benefit the production of nuclei resulting in a larger number of nuclei and a smaller average particle radius. This rationale fits the observed experimental trend so while diffusion, solubility and surface tension may contribute to the size trend, we conclude that the mechanism of In37P20 thermolysis is dominated by restricted surface growth. Similar conversion studies through thermolysis of myristate-ligated In37P20 clusters showed that little productive nucleation occurs at 150 °C. Instead, the cluster follows a dominant decomposition route resulting in poorly defined, agglomerated InP species.",
  "In this research, we developed an intelligent agent for text mining PI literature and an online TS-Tg-Tr performance predictor by fusing DK into LLM, successfully running research process prompts and adaptive code generation. We have cleverly devised a few-shot prompt engineering strategy in a cyclic ascent. Using this strategy, the agent accurately extracted key synthetic parameters from 84 PI publications, constructing a database of 543 groups. We further created an online prediction application as well as a pre-coding toolkit to issue. The aim of the interaction is to bridge the gap between chemists and computer scientists, harnessing LLM's strong retrieval and summarization skills to build on the power of ML. We anticipate that these prompts will inspire cross-disciplinary innovation across materials science and beyond.",
  "CSV documents containing year-wise market share and HHI data for reserves and production are converted into JSON format and are processed similarly, split, and stored in a separate vector database. Upon receiving a user query, the system reformats the query to ensure contextual relevance using the question formation prompt and the chat history detailed in TS2 of the supplementary material. This process is facilitated by the LLMChain module from LangChain, utilizing the open-source LLM \"Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct\" [26] available in the HuggingFaceHub library. The reformatted query is then processed by both vector retrievers retrieving the top K chunks based on the similarity scores between the query vector and the vectors of chunks.

A 3 fs timestep was used throughout.",
  "We found that access to the in silico 3D-structures provided by kinodata-3D is beneficial to the training of structure-based GNNs.

As illustrated in Fig. , N-terminal half is predicted as disordered and contains 7 acids, whereas C-terminal half is more structured and contain three acids encompassed by up to 12 basic residues. As enumerated in Tab. S6, DeepKa gives a RMSD of 0.41, close to 0.33 obtained by another tree-based pK a predictor XBG-WMa.

  "Employing pyrazole as the trapping agent led to formal insertion of the aryne into the N-H bond affording 9 as a single regioisomer in 55% yield. This regioselectivity is consistent with nucleophilic attack distal to the electronwithdrawing oxygen substituent . We observed similar reactivity in the addition of N-methyl aniline to give 10, albeit in a moderate 24% yield. These results indicated that trapping reactions beyond cycloadditions with furan could be viable and we explored the compatibility of a range of different trapping agents under our base-mediated conditions for aryne generation (table ).",

Thus, in order to observe the diffusion of larger molecules like CH4, the penetration energy barrier should be reduced somehow, either having larger pores, increasing CH4 pressure, or changing the grazyne either geometry or electronic structure so as to lower the repulsion between substrate and adsorbate (methane), particularly in the transition state.",
  "The first-generation analyzer was evaluated with ions from infused Pierce™ Calmix™ calibration solution, which contains m/z 195 caffeine, m/z 524 MRFA and ultramark across a range of masses but notably m/z 1422. Additional experiments were performed with an isobaric peptide mixture of angiotensin and bradykinin, to measure resolving power. A controllable number of ions of a desired isolation range were requested from the linear ion trap and delivered to the R-Trap for pulsed injection and analysis. Figure shows an example of a caffeine time-of-flight peak with 2000 ions requested, which with a flight time of 672 μs matches simulation. When tuned to good transmission the FWHM resolving power was 45k, though post-peak tailing and ringing are visible. The latter is an artifact detection, and almost certainly possible to tune out with further development of the PMT preamplifier electronics, though the former may well also relate to real stray ion signal. The isotopic envelope is also shown, and matches the distribution expected of caffeine.",

However, using only the density (and not the energy) of the proxy minimizes the errors made by this approximation. Using these approximations for FE and DE, ref 7 found that |FE| ≫ |DE| in reaction barrier heights, despite the well-documented fact that HF-DFT significantly reduces the errors of DFAs in predicting too-small barriers to chemical reactions. Reference 13 later confirmed this finding by using the optimized coupled cluster doubles density as a proxy for the exact one.",

A. Cotton.",
  "We believe that this investigation on the chemical bonding in HC n H chains was rewarding for several reasons. The present results reiterated and added further support to the fact that monitoring bond lengths alone does not suffice to adequately characterize chemical bonding in carbon chains.

  "As in our previous work on GNRs and NGRs we have used also here DFT (and TDDFT) theory employing the hybrid PBE0 functional (without \"adjustable parameters), which was found more than adequate. This is particularly true for the energy gaps which have been obtained with almost \"chemical accuracy\". In several controversial cases, as for example disputed energetical ordering of various spin states, we can correct the results, as we have illustrated earlier, by introducing correlation, even at the second order Moller-Plesset manybody perturbation theory (MP2). Thus, in the most contentious cases we have used either MP2 or double hybrid functionals which include by construction MP2 corrections, such as Grimme's B2PLYPD double-hybrid functional. In such cases the 6-311G(d,2p) basis set is applied as implemented in the Gaussian programme package. The same package is used for calculating the NICS(1) aromaticity index, which has been proven sufficient and adequate for the purposes of such comparisons. The results of the calculations have been visualized using the GaussView 28 software package.",

  "NP nucleants dispersed on a catalytically inert substrate, is representative of the typical nanocatalyst systems used in gas-evolving reactions. Individual Pt NPs on HOPG were encapsulated by a double-barrel pipette meniscus and H + reduction was performed. In this case, the pipette configuration allowed monitoring of bubble evolution via the ionic current flowing between the two barrels.

From that, two kinds of carbenes could be isolated and used further in complexation reactions: N-substitution with (neutral) Lewis-acids or substitution of the imidazole backbone. Substitution of the backbone can be achieved by reaction of a metallated NHC 1 with an electrophilic ERn source. The latter concept is more frequently reported as the electrophiles can range from group 3-6 main-group fragments or include transition metals such as zinc, which grants a modular approach to new ligands (Scheme 1). Reports for \"non-classical\" NHCs with for example CAAC -, malonate -or syndnone -frameworks are much more scarcely reported, as they require additional synthetic challenges.",
  "To investigate the potential reactivity of our proposed intermediate B, we conducted a DFT cluster model study for both intermediates A and B, similar to the approach used by Yu and Chen. Geometry optimizations converged for all species, as confirmed by frequency calculations (Fig. ). All reactant and product structures exhibited only real frequencies, while the transition states displayed a single large imaginary frequency with all other frequencies being real. The imaginary normal mode corresponded to hydrogen atom abstraction from C 9 by the oxo group on Fe B for both intermediates. Unpaired spin populations were consistent with values reported by Yu and Chen. 11",

Valence electrons were treated explicitly, and norm-conserving Goedecker-Teter-Hutter (GTH) pseudopotentials were used to account for the interaction between the valence electrons and the atomic cores.

  "Here, V KS is the atomic KS potential and r r0 p is a polynomial confinement potential. The motivation behind this confinement is that the orbitals of the isolated atom would be far too diffuse for applications in condensed phase systems. By applying a suitable empirical confinement radius r 0 and exponent p, one thus obtains compressed atomic orbitals that are much better suited for describing atoms in molecules or solids. Once the basis functions are defined, the KS Hamiltonian matrix can be computed. To this end, DFTB uses a two center approximation, so that the matrix element H µν is initially computed as:",

Given that carbene ligands typically favor the cyclopropane product in the chosen enyne cyclization/hydroarylation test reaction 6d, and that previous efforts to control regioselectivity in this reaction by tuning carbene ligand donor ability did not achieve selectivity for the alkene product, the attainment of exclusive alkene selectivity with catalyst 13c is a promising demonstration of the ability to override the intrinsic electron preference of a regiodivergent reaction though steric control.",

  "Third, while AF3 provides a static structural prediction, it does not capture the dynamics of PROTAC-mediated interactions, which can significantly influence binding affinity and degradation efficacy. MD simulations would provide a complementary method of validation by assessing complex stability over time, transient interactions, and induced-fit effects that AF3 alone cannot model. Although our study included limited MD validation, a comprehensive integration of MD simulations with AF3 predictions would further refine predictions and improve structure-based PROTAC design.",
  "The target characteristics of the relaxivity can be enhanced by conjugating the multiple ML complexes in the one dendrimer structure (Gd-DO3A ML complex was considered as a basic unit). The common and simple strategy aimed at control in the relaxivity characteristics is introducing the steric bottleneck that may also impact the kinetic inertness of the complexes.

A secondary, more shallow minimum occurs around 50 • , and it is separated from the global minimum by a small barrier near 70 • . The biggest challenge along this potential energy coordinate occurs in the ∼0-80 • region and above 120 •i.e. for the more planar structures.",
  "The analysis of vast combinatorial libraries without enumeration was first adressed in the works of Rarey et al. The authors exploited the property that CLs are composed of different building blocks (BBs) combined according to specific reaction rules to efficiently analyze, search, and compare even nonenumerable combinatorial spaces. The main principle of these methods is to represent each fragment of a molecule by fingerprint representations that capture their chemical and topological features or encode a compound as a tree of its fragment features describing the ability of forming interactions. For example, the Ftrees methodology enables fast query-based similarity searches in CL spaces based on feature trees.",

  "While f max may have the desired formal properties, it arguably takes things too far since it ultimately makes the predicted molecular or materials property a function of a single atomic contribution. In real interacting systems, even fairly localized orbitals will typically extend over several atoms, however. More importantly, it would be desirable to have a pooling function that is simultaneously adequate both for localized and delocalized properties. A simple way to achieve this is via softmax pooling:",
  "(2) Imaging in the SWIR region was a breakthrough for deep tissue fluorescence imaging, because of lower scattering; the structure and synthesis of SWIR TAMs e.g. TAM2CF are however vastly simple. We expect that further rational red-shifting of TAMs will easily reach PA agents with maxima > 1000 nm. This threshold is important: the maximal clinically permissible laser power exposure at >1000 nm is greater than in the NIR; and since TAMs' ultrafast knr makes them linear absorbers, they can convert higher laser power directly into higher PA signal. (3) TAMs avoid the metabolic liability of using azobenzene molecular switches for fast-relaxing dyes (the electrophilic, reducible, N=N bond), so they might prove still better performant in vivo. (4) A major aim of MSOT in vivo is to monitor biological function with probes that respond to enzyme activity or biomarker dynamics, e.g. by undergoing a strong bathochromic absorption jump upon an enzymatic reaction. The TAM motif offers a dramatic spectral jump of +550 nm upon central leaving group expulsion (Fig ). This can surely be addressed by techniques known from e.g. lactone-opening-based xanthene probes, to deliver enzyme-triggered PA probes with outstanding sensitivity (turn-on from zero background), as well as ratiometric PA probes. (5) The higher ε of TAMs in apolar environments suggests that TAM structural tuning has room to also increase ε in polar solvents, and thus increase the SGE.",

First the topology parameters of protein were created and the complex was immersed in a cubic box of simple point charge (SPC) water molecules. The \"solvated system\" (protein, ions, small molecule and water) was neutralized by adding required counter-ions Na or Cl. To equilibrate the system, the solutes (Proteins, counterions, and two drugs) were subjected to the positionrestrained dynamics simulation (NVT and NPT) at 299.177 K for 1ns.

  "Having computed the preferred equilibrium minima states for the hydrophilic and permeable HL1 with MC-DFT modelling, we explored its kinetic behaviors using MD in explicit water (Figure & SI Section_16) and compared it to MZ1. During each unbiased 2 us simulation at 300 K (OPLS with initial geometries from DFT-calculated global minima), the MZ1 with shorter PEG3 linker remained in relatively discrete U-shaped local minima for hundreds of nanoseconds at a time, which reproduce the phenomenon reported by a previous simulation based on the GAFF force-field. In contrast, the HL1 bearing longer PPG3 linker, rapidly oscillated on a short timescale (< 10 ns) among many distinct states after an initial period of equilibration. We hypothesize the kinetic behavior of MZ1 in solution may facilitate its binary binding process under less entropic penalty as reported in other PROTAC systems, with the converse true of HL1. This is supported by further simulation results of the more flexible MZ2 (SI Sec-tion_16). Notably, we observed frequent transitions of opened conformations (Rgyr > 0.8 nm) for these flexible and hydrophilic PROTACs in water, indicating possible pathways toward POI/E3 engagement feasibly. To further understand impacts of linker on binding and degradation behaviours, and particularly the experimentally observed hook-effect especially for HL1CON. we investigated conformations of PROTAC-bound binary complexes (i.e., with either VHL or BRD4:BD2) responsible for subsequent ternary complex formation.",

The remaining four global parameters (k a , k norm , k CN erf , and k BC ) were chosen during the fit to optimize the final partial charges and to balance the trade-off between enabling genuine and preventing artificial CT. In particular, the decay parameter of the bond capacitance k BC must be fixed to avoid the complete deactivation of the BC constraints in favor of a larger genuine CT in zwitterionic systems.

  "The renewable electrical energy supply will cause fluctuations in energy availability, manageable with two different boarder case strategies: First, the use of buffer systems, which use excess electrical energy to produce valuable and/or storable compounds (e.g. Power-to-X concepts). Second, operation of fully dynamic processes, which induces a complex spatialtemporal behavior of chemical reactors operated based on renewable energies . Most probably a mixture of both concepts might be the techno-economical optimum . Both boarder scenarios and a realistic mixture thereof need flexibility in the involved processes and require unsteady-state or dynamic operation in particular, ensuring stability in all states of the process. The effort to stabilize the dynamic behavior of chemical systems is depending on the tolerance of the system and needs comprehensive understanding of the intrinsic dynamics of all involved sub-processes meaning the processes on different scales .",

Precursor 11 mixes readily with AlCl 3 but the reaction mixture quickly turns into a dark sticky residue that is difficult to stir efficiently.

Charges on atoms neighboring with Cu are larger than those from DFT. Spins on these neighboring atoms are very small. This is also supported by Loewdin analysis (Table ). Nonrelativistic CASSCF excited states are well separated from the ground state (GS) and this separation is significantly enlarged with inclusion of dynamic correlations at NEVPT2 level.",
  "Xu and Moeller developed strategies to form amidyl radicals which are able to undergo cyclizations via addition to unsaturated carbons by direct anodic oxidation. In his independent career Xu refined this concept also to other N-centered radicals which led to a palette of powerful cascade reactions. The formation of the amidyl radical is either achievable via proton-coupled electron transfer by direct anodic oxidation or by e.g. ferrocene (3) mediated oxidation of amidyl anions (after deprotonation by cathodically formed methoxide, Scheme 2a). While direct electrolysis was required to cyclize 11 to benzimidazolone 12, the electrosynthesis of indole 14 from 13 was achieved under mediation. When these mediating conditions were applied to substrates related to 11 only traces of the rearomatized product were observed. This displays again that mediating conditions often lead to different major products but initially to the same reactive intermediates.",

  "For MD simulations, the ligand is parameterized with Antechamber 25 available from AmberTools, while the truncated protein is parameterized with tleap. Truncation of the protein is done with an in-house script taking into account the atom number limit (see below), which also changes the mass of Cα atoms to a special value, so as to fix these atoms in subsequent simulations.

  "A common behaviour (seen, for example, in the 34 K data in Fig. ) is that χT initially relaxes sigmoidally, but at longer times the relaxation slows and can be fit by a stretched exponential function, e -kτ t β with β < 1. Experimentally, such 'mixed relaxations' have been observed in several SCO materials. For example, [Fe(bppSMe) 2 ][BF 4 ] 2 exhibits behaviour similar to the calculations presented in Fig. : single step SCO, a single negative peak in ∂(χT )/∂T , and mixed isothermal kinetics with stretched tails. We observe complex relaxation dynamics with temperature dependent regime changes for many other parameter regimes with a wide range of intermediate incipient orders.",

It can firstly be noted that, in all of the conditions except pH 4 phosphate (green), the surface initially shows adsorbed CO at 0.9 V on the forward with bound MA) appears after accessing higher potentials. This would suggest that maleate is a more prominent spectator than furoate under the conditions that are selective to FA product (lower organic coverage imposed by adsorbed electrolyte).",

  "From an 88 bisdithiolene complex subset, we generated a 276 complex dataset by mutating terminal chalcogen sites to contain O, S and Se atoms and performed DFT calculations. Over this set, we observed that the metal-local environment of bisdithiolene Mo/W complexes (e.g., angles accessed by ligands) depends strongly on metal coordination number. In contrast, the electronic properties of the complexes depend less on the metal-local geometry but more on the ligand and metal identities as well as metal formal oxidation states. We compared transition metal complex properties to those observed from MD and QM/MM simulation of a representative FDH enzyme. The protein environment influences the geometry of the cofactor by decreasing both folding and twisting angles around the metal decrease. Trends in electronic properties observed for molecular complexes, however, hold for the cofactor in the enzyme environment, suggesting that molecular complexes are faithful mimics of the enzyme from an electronic structure perspective.",

  "Using MOFChecker, we can identify the amount of missing charge in the structure. We can determine the counterions used in the original literature by calling the CSD library API. We can perform Monte Carlo (MC) simulations under the NVT ensemble using the Universal Force Field (UFF) to reinsert these missing counterions. Figure gives an example of a MOF that was originally charged. By adding the missing missing counter ions BF - 4 a neutral MOF is obtained.",

  "As discussed by Wright et al. and Righetto et al., charge carriers in Bi-and Sb-based double halide perovskites undergo, self-trapping within ~ps of photoexcitation. Such localisation process radically changes the transport regime of the charge carriers in the material: photogenerated free charge carriers which exhibit bandlike transport of large polarons rapidly transfer to a small-polaronic stateassociated with strong electron-phonon interactions which diffuse through the material by temperature-activated hopping transport. The poorer electronic coupling and energy barriers associated with the hopping process lead to lower values of charge-carrier mobility. Hence, changes in the charge-carrier mobility over a picosecond timescalecaused by charge-carrier localisationmake optical pump THz probe (OPTP) spectroscopy a powerful technique to reveal the signatures of this process in our materials.",
  "We further introduce the technique of template database expansion to demonstrate other practical value of the reconstructed template space and its implication of reaction space exploration.

  "While StyBtz2, which we had expected might be Z-active, did disrupt microtubule network architecture and depress cell proliferation under lit conditions, mechanistic tests of G2/M phase arrest and inhibition of purified tubulin showed that these effects cannot be traced to Z-StyBtz2 binding tubulin. Having excluded significant phototoxicity but identified problematic GSH-lability, we could use the StyBtz's self-reporting fluorescence to track their accumulation into and light-dependent release from mitochondria in acute imaging experiments. These live cell experiments also hint at mechanisms behind their light-dependent acute cytotoxicity, which can now be studied further, towards harnessing StyBtz/StyTz's mitochondrial localisation for photopharmaceutical applications against different biological targets.",

For this effort, we keep fixed the hydrogen ion in the bridge site, instead, and translate the OH -ion along our radial grid. Again, the grid points were defined spanning the transverse axes in increment of 0.75 Å, although the hydrogen of the OH -was initially randomly rotated with the O-H bond distance set to its equilibrium value (d OH = 0.98 Å). In this way, this potential energy surface was explored while minimizing spurious results arising from an ordered grid of OH ions.",
  "Also the MCP pulses are fed to the HPTDC8 board via an OR-gate. The board records the arrival times of all these timing pulses relative to the trigger (\"Trig\") signal that, for pulsed-mode ions-only spectroscopy, is generated by the \"Quantum Composers\" TTL pulse generator and then converted to a NIM level. The trigger is routed through a delay generator but again, this comes necessary only in coincident detection. The trigger signal is split to provide a simultaneous trigger pulse for the high-voltage extraction pulse generator (PVM-4210 model from Berkeley Nuclonics Co.). The various timing pulses collected by the HPTDC8 board are processed by the proprietary CoboldPC software from Roentdek GmbH, which eventually stores the results -either processed ion TOF and position, or raw timing hits -of a measurement in various file formats (\".bin\", \".lmf\"), that can be later processed by other software.

  "For the benefit of the community, we ask that reference LC-MS datasets are publicly provided, including the abovementioned metadata on chromatographic conditions . Models may use chromatographic features beyond column chemistry and pH when more training data become available. Transferable prediction requires HSM or Tanaka parameters of the column; we ask column vendors to make these parameters available. In our experiments, regression beyond polynomials did not improve predictions results, but this clearly depends on the target datasets. Better ROI prediction accuracy will enable retention time prediction even for exceptional chromatographic gradients using more intricate methods for mapping ROI to RT (Figure ). Consequently, we conjecture that huge improvements in transferable RT prediction will be possible in the near future. HILIC separation mechanisms are even more diverse than for RP, and no generally agreed parameters exist to describe column selectivity, making transferable retention time prediction for HILIC the next big challenge.",

  "The power of this visualization technique was evidenced by generating various µGTM landscapes providing a clear overview of the ensemble of considered libraries. To create such landscapes, µ-maps were colored based on the intrinsic library features such as the number of chemistry cycles and reaction types (either coupling or heterocyclization transformation). This allowed to instantaneously identify and highlight the nature of the closest DEL neighbors of ChEMBL: 2-building block (BB) or 3BB library, employing a particular reaction type. Maps can also be colored by the estimated cost of each DEL synthesis, substantially simplifying the process of selection of the library for screening for medicinal chemists considering multiple factors at the same time. This functionality of µGTM -the ability to color the map by any library feature -is useful to consider extra information when analyzing the CLS in addition to the already existing structural and/or property similarity information of the libraries.",

  "DVA thus provides estimations of LLI and LAM undergone upon aging. Complementary to DVA, plotting electrochemical curves in cumulative capacity scale foregrounds information that cannot be attained directly from slippages (Figure , bottom right). Indeed, marching of charge capacities (see definition in Box 1) reveals, when no LAM is recorded, side oxidation reactions while marching of discharge capacities indicates side reactions at the negative electrode, including SEI formation . Complementary to slippages and marching, incremental capacity analysis (ICA) relying on dQ/dV vs. V derivative curves is used to spot irreversible phase transitions of active materials, by tracking changes in peak position and intensity during aging. Furthermore, it can detect lithium plating by observing extra peak in charge , raise in cell polarization or any change in voltage range window of either electrode. LAM or LLI at electrodes can also be obtained, even if less trivial . Aside from derivative analysis, voltage drop during self-discharge tests at the open circuit voltage (OCV) are analyzed to detect parasitic reactions with the electrolyte or redox shuttle through lithium re-intercalation , while lithium plating is observed by the appearance of a so-called mixt potential during relaxation time after charge . Finally, to complete the arsenal of electrochemical techniques available to detect single degradation phenomenon, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) in three electrodes configuration are the methods of choice to distinguish contribution of each electrode to changes in cell impedance and assess cell polarization. Despite this extensive knowledge, analysis methods, when used in isolation, fall short at capturing multiple degradation modes which occur simultaneously at both electrodes and that influence each other's. This inter-dependence, or cross-talking, intensify over aging/cycling and accumulate until triggering additional degradations that can lead to a snowball effect and trigger rollover failure .",

  "Through evaluations on two datasets in subsection 6.1, we have shown that the proposed 3D-CNN and PCN models can effectively classify correct or incorrect poses. In most real screening applications, however, the docking poses are used for evaluation, due to the lack of crystal structures. We now demonstrate the applicability of the proposed pose classification with molecular docking-based screening tasks. To this end, we used two different OOD datasets; PDB ion-channel and in-house KCa3.1 datasets. Structurebased molecular docking processes such as AutoDock Vina, MOE-Dock 49 and Glide 50 generate multiple poses with scores using their empirical scoring functions. The topranked poses based on their scores are then identified as correct ligand binding poses.",

  "On a side note, in alanine dipeptide at T = 300 K, PGMs with the same architecture were also separately trained on the available biased MD data, obtained from the metadynamics calculations that were performed earlier to obtain ground truth free energy differences, to check if reweighting via BAR would be able to recover the unbiased free energy differences (SI Fig. ). That result aligns well with previous conclusions about the robustness of BAR with respect to model accuracy. A possibility for training PGMs on biased data is, for instance, relevant when considering a broader utility of learned maps in umbrella sampling.",
  "Until now, our st-CpHMD method implementation was compatible with the GROMOS and CHARMM force field families in the GROMACS software package. Here, we have extended the method to enable CpHMD simulations using AMBER 14SB. Since the charge parameterization procedure of this force field does not enforce charge neutrality to the residues' main chains, we proposed a small modification to the official ff14SB atomic partial charges to make them st-CpHMD-compatible. Using simulations of dipeptide combinations with all titrating residues (and termini), we showed that this modification did not alter significantly the conformational and energetic landscape of the official force field. Long MD simulations of HEWL with the modified charge set also showed no measurable impact on the secondary structure.",

  "Herein, we applied a structure-based strategy and predictive computational modelling to modify the PEG3 linker in PROTAC MZ1 to explore VHL-based BET degraders with high BRD4:BD2 cooperativity (Figure ). The alternative PPG3 linker of HL1 was designed to further stabilise productive ternary complexes originally formed by MZ1 according to available crystal structure. Meanwhile, the pan-BET PROTAC ARV771 was modelled to show the plasticity of ternary complex, where the BRD4:BD2 target is shifted to another position on VHL E3-ligase, and such a pose could allow broad degradation selectivity of the BET family. This work benefited from the utilization of a simple approach of multiple simulated annealing (MSA) in enhanced MD simulations, without any artificial biased potential along collective variable (CV) or expensive weighted ensemble (WE) / Markov-state Modelling (MSM), to accelerate conformational exchange and identify rare conformational transitions for global energy minimizations when starting from a crystallographic geometry with high stability. Since small alteration of linker might be able to induce completely different pose of ternary complex, it again addresses the importance of physics-driven modelling and linker conformational analysis in the structure-based PROTAC optimizations.",

  "The xTB calculation quickly produces orbitals and orbital energies, which can be treated using simplified Tamm-Dancoff approximated (sTDA) time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT). This workflow, sTDA-xTB, produces CD spectra of the lowest energy conformers relatively quickly, even for molecular systems with hundreds of atoms . A peak score is defined as the signed area under the spectrum for wavelengths 450-550nm, a region where small organic molecules can have CD signals, and is also within the visible range for possible materials applications. Maximizing the peak score produces chiral optically active materials within the blue region of visible light.",
  "The inclusion of the fluctuation terms leads to a dependence of the energy on the KS orbitals (via the Mulliken charges), so that the equations must be solved self-consistently.

  "Gas-phase geometry optimizations and single-point energy calculations were performed using density functional theory (DFT) with a development version of TeraChem v1.9. 119 The B3LYP 120-122 global hybrid functional with the empirical D3 dispersion correction 123 using Becke-Johnson damping 124 was employed for all calculations. The LACVP* composite basis set was employed throughout this work, which consists of a LANL2DZ effective core potential for Mn, Fe, Br, and I, and the 6-31G* basis 127 for all other atoms. As in prior work, we focus on relative energetics over a large data set, and we neglect solvent corrections and zero-point vibrational energy or entropic corrections to avoid a significant increase in computational cost. Singlet calculations were carried out in a spin-restricted formalism following prior work , whereas all other spin states were performed as unrestricted calculations. The convention of majority-spin addition of radicals is employed throughout. Level shifting 128 of 0.25 Ha was applied to both majority and minority spin virtual orbitals to aid self-consistent field (SCF) convergence to an unrestricted solution. Geometry optimizations were carried out with the translation rotation internal coordinate (TRIC) optimizer 129 using the L-BFGS algorithm. Default tolerances in the convergence criteria were employed for the maximum energy gradient of 4.5×10 -4 hartree/bohr and energy difference between steps of 10 -6 hartree. The initial geometries for metal-oxo species were constructed using molSimplify, 130 which uses OpenBabel 131, 132 as a backend to interpret SMILES strings. Tetradentate macrocycle SMILES strings were constructed using custom algorithms available in molSimplify and validated using RDKit version 2020.03.2. We oriented any methyl groups on metal-coordinating atoms syn relative to the metal-oxo to follow the most common isomer in experimentally characterized metal-oxo compounds. Job submission was automated by molSimplify with a 24 h wall time per run with up to five resubmissions. Geometry optimizations were carried out with geometry checks 137 prior to each resubmission and structures that failed any check were eliminated (Supporting Information Table ). Open-shell structures were also removed from the data set following established protocols if the expectation value of the S 2 operator deviated from its expected value of S(S + 1) by >1 μB 2 or the combined Mulliken spin density on the metal and oxygen differed from the spin multiplicity by >1 μB.

  "Because intermolecular electron-phonon (Peierls) couplings are particularly detrimental to change transport for this class of systems, this analysis focuses upon off-diagonal, nonlocal (intermolecular) couplings. Intermolecular transfer integrals are calculated from the dimer projection approach, determined from single point energy calculations performed with the ORCA v4.0 code, employing the PBE0 density functional and def2-SVP basis set with HOMO-HOMO matrix elements representing transfer integrals for hole transport. Sign consistency of each transfer integral was affirmed using \"ghost\" hydrogenic 1S atomic orbitals to evaluate the phase of the molecular orbitals for each molecule in the given dimer.

  "In Marcus theory, this property is included via a parameter, while in the non-adiabatic simulations, it sensitively depends on the structural changes upon (de-) excitation and a correct description can be highly method-dependent. E.g., for electron transfer we found DFT/GGA functionals and also LC-DFTB2 not accurate enough in this respect, therefore we had to train neural networks to account for the relaxation . Alternatively, our formalism also allows to include this as a parameter, which we call 'implicit relaxation' .",
  "The QM/MM simulations reveal some restoration of onebond-flip events as the rotations about the ϕI and ϕP dihedrals is once again less restricted. 70% of the excited state trajectories have dihedrals going up to 90 • of twist. However, unlike the WT, some of the isomerization was Itwisting and some was P-twisting, indicating that while we did succeed at determining a rescue mutation it might not be entirely for the reasons we originally supposed. This is in accord with the increased fluctuation of the interplanar angle between the rings, suggesting that the A157N mutation allows the chromophore to access additional nonradiative decay pathways as it adopts different geometric conformations (see Supplementary Figure and Figure ).",
  "The rapid disappearance of this signal (t1=140 fs) is attributed to back electron transfer (BET) that results in reformation of iodide, as in previous studies of similar clusters (Eq 4a). BET becomes less favorable if the iodine moves away from the valence-bound anion, a reasonable expectation given that the iodine/VB anion interaction potential will be quite different from the ground state Iˉ×4TU potential. Once the I atom moves away, autodetachment (AD, Eq. 4b) can become the primary decay mechanism.",

  "Electrodes containing single crystal NMC811 particles were cycled at voltage windows that promote oxygen loss and its corresponding surface reconstruction. The resulting O K-edge XAS spectral features were investigated by performing DFT, and DFMT simulations of different possible rock-salt structures. The results show that the so-called rock-salt layer can be a combination of compounds of the type LixNi1-xO (with x = 0 to 0.125, x = 0 indicating NiO). The transport properties among these compounds differ according to AIMD simulations, resulting in kinetically trapped lithium in the bulk of NMC811 particles with NiO being the compound that hinders Li + mobility the most. Operando XRD studies test the extent of the surface reconstruction to trap lithium ions showing it is minor in the first postformation cycle and develops after prolonged cycling. In long-term cycling, we anticipate the densification of surface reconstruction favours the formation of NiO over other compounds. Passivating the surface to prevent oxygen loss is then key to overcoming this \"trapped Li\" and ultimately improving battery performance.",
  "A cursory glance at an experimental curve looking like that depicted in Fig. can easily be taken as \"evidence\" of a tunnelinghopping crossover or-in view of the T -dependent slope (\"activation energy\")-of a variable variable-range hopping. In reality, we have seen that, it is the tunneling that is at work there both at low and high T . Emphasizing this point, the results reported above aim at aiding the molecular electronics community in not rushing conclude a transition from tunneling to hopping merely based on measured transport properties that switch from nearly temperature independent (Sommerfeld regime) to strongly temperature dependent (Arrhenius-like regime) upon rising the temperature.",

  "The RAES spectra of CO following the 1s → 2π excitation at the C and O K-edges are presented in Fig. The resonant Auger spectra of CO have been the subject of previous computational studies where the one center approximation has been used. In Ref. 78, the complete active space configuration interaction (CASCI) approach was employed together with a TZP basis set. The authors also computed the vibrationally resolved spectrum for the carbon Kedge, treatment of the electron in the continuum. Thus, the agreement observed between our results and those of the above-mentioned computational studies was expected. An advantage of our methodology (as already highlighted in Section 1) is the possibility of computing Auger decay rates with a set of non-orthonormal CASSCF molecular orbitals optimized for each manifold separately. Hence, electronic relaxation following core-excitations and correlation effects -further introduced by perturbation correction of second order -are properly taken into account.",

  "Each of these special classes was assigned 62 or more MOFs upon manual analysis of manuscripts or stability information curated in the supplementary material of previous work by Burtch et al. Unlike the water stability classes, these classes are not mutually exclusive, i.e., an acid-stable MOF can also be base-stable, although any MOF identified to have stability for one of these harsh conditions can only be classified as either HK or TS. Comparing the label distribution of WS14s Fractions sum to more than 1 due to the presence of MOFs with multiple metals. Metals are ordered by frequency in WS24.",
  "Overall, we thus obtained LPC parameters for elements with Z = 1-86 (excluding the lanthanide series) for use with the min+s basis set and the PBE functional. The min+s basis set and the LPC correction are accessible through the corresponding species defaults in FHI-aims starting from version 231212 in species_defaults/defaults_2020/minimal+s, which automatically include the keyword to enable the basis set error corrections (currently parameterized for use with the min+s basis set and the PBE functional) for energies, forces and stresses.",
  "Beside a small cluster around zero, due to the randomly selected geometry itself and a few extremely similar ones, all the RMSD distribution from random frames lie to the right of that of the average structure.

  "Given the prevalence of these moieties within promising candidates identified by the ucGA, we collected similar structures in the reFORMED fragment pool by searching for all fragments possessing (a) three adjacent heteroatoms in a ring system and (b) formal charges. Since appropriate energetics in donor-acceptor compounds depend predominantly on the acceptor species, we paired them with the well-studied bithiophene donor. We then examined the characteristics of the acceptors on equal footing by screening the resulting D-A dimers using the trained ML models to identify those which induce suitable SF energetics and excited state character in donor-acceptor systems.",
  "The experimental trace matches the simulation in performance, though more closely resembles the slightly hardened TE1-0.005 plot than the zero-space charge optimum. This small shift may simply be due to the space charge inherent in the TE1 calibration. Remarkably the space charge performance appears to substantially improve for the full-MS experiment. The 50K resolving power crossing point was almost doubled, from 2500 to 5000 ions in peak, when the MRFA trapped ion cloud was broadened by other calibrant ions. An important consideration raised from the simulation results in Figure was that the conditions in the extraction trap, particularly space charge from the distribution of different trapped ions, could influence behaviour in the ToF analyzer. The most straightforward explanation is that broadening of the trapped ion volume under space charge helps mitigate resonant space charge effects in the analyzer, as the initial density of like m/z ions is reduced, and thus charge density of ions in flight is reduced.",

  "The influence of nanoscale CF surface roughness on CFRCs was explored with distinct types of CF surface roughness. The hills CF features highly graphitic and locally smooth free surfaces with long continuous graphene edges exposed to the polymer matrix and a global corrugation that is aligned along the x coordinate of the unit cell. Conversely, the sandpaper CF exhibits short lengthscale roughness with a greater degree topographical disorder at the surface, but is globally flat. Composite pre-cursors were formed by interfacing the CF substrates with a liquid mixture of EPON/DETDA, resulting in a slab geometry unit cell with the CF surfaces normal to the z coordinate, as shown in Figures and.",

MW-based comparisons are often performed for polymers , however, this results in length-dependent differences for various analyses on a molecular level. Therefore, we additionally investigated a DP (and backbone length)-equivalent variant of pEtOx. Polymers were linked to two carbon chains via a click chemistry-based triazole structure. We recently reported the synthesis of such elements via electron-deficient acetylenedicarboxylate lipids, enabling efficient coupling of various polymer chains end-capped with suitable azide groups .",

  "In conclusion, we have observed synergistic degradation and isolated their contributions in SC LiNi and NiO. Secondly, the improved kinetics of oxygen vacancies with increasing depth of discharge results in densified reduced surface phases that lead to additional kinetic barriers for Li-ion diffusion (e.i. trapped lithium). As a result, the choice of the high-and-low voltage cutoffs ultimately dictates your cycle longevity. Whilst demonstrated here for NMC 811 chemistry, we expect this synergistic mechanism to be universal for NMC / graphite systems when operating at regimes to induce oxygen loss (regardless of Ni content). Furthermore, it should also be apparent in next-generation chemistries such as Li-excess/SiO x -graphite systems.",
  "Zeolites of 305 kg was used while Brian solution of 10% was used to regenerate the zeolite beds. About 1948 kg was obtained as a crude fertilizer, while the remaining liquids were discharged. Unlike other methods, MFC was a stand-alone WW treatment system, where in microbes consumes the SS as well as generate crude fertilizer. About 5.5 t of crude fertilizer could be obtained in MFC process, which was the highest among all methods compared, as no N or P was lost during the STP process. This shows that MFCs could be a potential solution to WW treatment and nutrient recovery. Nonetheless, the scalability at large, reproducibility and membrane fouling, or damage issues needs to be looked upon.",
  "At the next step to clarify the structure of the active site preceding the oxidation we located the position of dioxygen molecule within the WTox model. It is experimentally well established that the dioxygen molecules from the water bulk can penetrate proteins and occupy hydrophobic cavities . Our previous experience with simulation of protein-oxygen interaction hinted that there can be numerous oxygen pathways from the bulk to the At this state we switched to the restricted singlet ωB97x-D3/6-31G** wavefunction and obtained the dioxetanone intermediate.

  "When XRPD profiles are collected in a PDF setup, meaning with high energy of the primary beam and the detector at only 243 mm downstream the sample, they suffer from low angular resolution and are often dominated by background from diffuse scattering. Consequently, Bragg peaks strongly overlap and become difficult to identify. In these conditions, recognizing structural variations of crystalline phases becomes difficult. Conversely, PDF profiles, which encode information on the local structure, are better suited for interpretating structural changes caused by active atoms and distinguishing them from contribution from bulk and \"silent\" atoms. Moreover, PDF profiles are highly valuable for discerning significant components in PCA, as they have specific features characterizing their envelope and power spectrum. Thus, components loadings showing a stronger contribution from high frequencies, like those shown in Figures and, can be deemed insignificant.",

  "Attempts to run the annulation process provided exclusively the allylated pyrrolidine 3a with slightly higher yields (48% and 45%, resp. vs. 42% and 38% without ligand exchange). These results suggest that InP-ZnS QDs are promising catalysts to perform the simple allylation reaction. This selectivity may tentatively be attributed to the limited reducing power of their conduction band that does not allow the final reduction of the bicyclic α-ester radical (see discussion of the mechanism, vide infra).",

Such freestanding oxides are envisioned to yield material combinations not accessible by conventional epitaxy routes and, moreover, to potentially establish new physical phenomena that arise from restricted dimensions and confinement. For example, the electronic-ionic properties of such thin freestanding oxide layers may be expected to be fully dominated by space-charge-type defect distributions that form in the vicinity of their surfaces and interfaces . This may imply for example an overall facilitated formation of defects or enhanced ion dynamics in the confined systems as compared to the bulk .",

  "Next probable reason is given by the weak electron donor-acceptor complex relationship between 2-CP and the MOFs. Upon termination of water molecules through vacuum drying, the unsaturated Cr (III) Lewis acid sites on MIL-101 serve as electron acceptor whereas the -chloro (Cl) substituent on 2-CP is an electron withdrawing group (EWG) . Thermal activation of AC usually leads to establishment of basic oxygen groups on the surface . This region, rich in electrons acts as donors and subsequently reduces the π-electrons of phenols while reinforcing the affinity to π-electrons on AC. Intuitively, this explains why existence of EWGs like -Cl and NO 2 on phenolic compounds favoured adsorption onto AC much more in contrast to attachment of electron donating groups (EDGs) like -CH 3 and -CH 2 CH 3 .",
  "In complementary work, Heine et al. reported DFTB parameters for nearly the full periodic table (termed QUASINANO2013), exclusively focusing on the electronic structure. This work was subsequently extended to provide full parameterizations (including repulsive potentials) of all elements Z<20 and Bromine. Very recently, complementary spin-orbit coupling parameters were also reported. In contrast to the GFN models, these parameters follow the original DFTB formulation and were fitted using the band structures of real and fictitious homoelemental crystal structures as reference data.",
  "DFT calculations were performed using the quantum ESPRESSO software using ON-CVPSP pseudopotentials 31 from pseudodojo, under the PBE exchange-correlation functional, and with the empirical dispersion by Grimme. The plane wave energy cutoff was set to 100 Ry, and calculations were converged to 10 -6 eV. Geometry optimizations were converged to 10 -5 eV and 10 -4 eVÅ -1 for energy and forces, respectively. Taking into account that systems of very different sizes have been studied, the number of k points was systematically selected such that the distance between points in the reciprocal space was about 0.25Å -1 .",
  "In this study, we substituted the conventional concentrate HF in etching protocol of silica cores in particle brushes with a less hazardous aqueous NH4HF2 approach. A comparable effectiveness was achieved while it is more benign to both the researchers and the environment. This work may inspire future studies that overhaul other highly hazardous protocol well-accepted by a research community. Besides that, the nanosphere we observed in the organic phase after etching with an excess of HF challenges the conventional understanding of our peer researchers in the polymer nanocomposite community that the etching is complete. Future qualitative and quantitative studies are warranted to further understand the nature of those residual spheres and their interaction with the SEC columns.",
  "With regards to crossover of RAOMs, the Schubert group has recently raised concerns that membrane crossover in AORFB symmetric cells could lead to misrepresented capacity fade trends. However, this concern appears unwarranted given the multiple studies of novel functionalized anthraquinone species or ferri-/ferrocyanide demonstrating permeabilities through as-received and ion-exchanged (sodium or potassium) Nafion on the order of 10 Nafion membranes to pretreatment (typically heating in deionized water, then soaking in dilute hydrogen peroxide). 17, While this treatment preferentially increases membrane conductivity, it does so at the expense of increased membrane swelling which results in faster crossover, thus providing an excessively high permeability benchmark-handily beat when reporting novel membrane chemistries for AORFBs.",
  "2. This model requires that a pair of structural analogues participating in relative free energy calculations have similar binding modes, which is achieved by superimposing the largest common substructure of the binding modes. This operation not only satisfies the recognition of medicinal chemists for lead optimization, but also reduces the risks of inaccurate pose predictions in traditional methods on RBFE modeling. Moreover, this operation has been proven to be helpful for ligand-based virtual screening and affinity prediction .",
  "This is a dimensionless geometric parameter that captures the extent to which the A-site cation fills the cavities of the anionic BX 3 framework. A value α = 1 implies perfect filling, which in turn prevents framework distortion. Decreasing the value of α generally induces volume-reducing distortions in the structure to compensate for the poorer geometric fit. Recognising the relationship between tolerance factor and structural distortions has enabled targeted control over perovskite crystal structures-as in A 2 CrWO 6 (A = Ba, Sr, and Ca -and is seen as a crucial design approach for optimising functional response in e.g. magnetoresistive and photovoltaic perovskites.",
  "Naturally, satisfying the high-density limit is most relevant in regions approaching high electron densities and thus properties that sample these regions. In molecular systems, this mostly concerns core regions and core properties such as core excitations, in particular of heavy elements. In fact, even most XC functionals constructed for describing core excitations violate the high-density limit, thus leaving significant potential for new developments to incorporate the scaling conditions.",

  "CHARMM36m-CGenFF. The initial ligand coordinates for the X-ray and :lipped poses for each compound were taken as described above in system preparation. The CHARMM36m force :ield was used for the protein and the CHARMM general force :ield (CGenFF) for the ligands (Tables and). Two separate protein-ligand complexes (one for X-ray pose and one for :lipped pose) including crystal waters were formed for each compound using CHARMM. This initial system was minimized using 200 steps SD in the presence of harmonic position restraints on the protein followed by 1000 steps of adopted basis Newton-Raphson (ABNR) minimization in the absence of restraints.

  "In the workflow, chemical structures and protein structures are the primary inputs. Depending on different purposes, the chemical input can be an atom, a fragment structure, or a fragment library in the format of a tab-split file containing structure SMILES and ID. If needed, the provided SMILES can be converted into a 3D structure using ETKDG v2 built in RDKit. Tautomer and spiro centers are also enumerated on demand. For AutoDock Vina docking, the ligands are converted from SDF format to PDBQT format using Open Babel v3.1.1. Fragment libraries are recommended for hypothesis-driven hit discovery, especially when limited binders against the target of interest are reported. Protein 3D structures are prepared from crystal structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB).

Enamine's November 2019 REAL space library (12.3 billion compounds) was reduced to a Rule-of-Four chemical subspace by excluding compounds with a molecular weight over 400 MW and cLogP over 4 as calculated by the RDKit. The total size of the Rule-of-Four subspace was 3,541,746,925 compounds.

  "By incorporating Tanimoto similarity into this framework, we aimed to explore how well a similarity-based approach could complement traditional SFs. Our findings suggest that EvolvedComplexity captures key structural changes in a manner consistent with established SFs, particularly in reactions involving significant structural reorganization, such as transannular cyclizations. While not a substitute for complexity scoring, that can easily compare different classes of small molecules, EC offers a promising complimentary tool for evaluating molecular evolution across synthetic pathways that may prove to be a useful metric for synthetic planning and cheminformatics studies.",
  "The significant change of kH/kD on zirconia after KOH doping indicates that the TS geometry has changed and must include KOH as part of it. However, it may happen without involvement of the OH as a new basic center on surface, in view of literature reports that doping zirconia with alkaline metals, K, or Cs, had no effect on surface basicity, and even reducing concentration of both strong and moderate basic sites after doping with Na. Instead, Zr sites hosting carboxylates may additionally include K or OH, that would alter the surface carboxylate geometry and align the alpha-carbon, the transferring hydrogen, and the lattice oxygen accepting the hydrogen in a straight line, which facilitates enolization.",

  "Extending the types of corrosion phenomena amenable to study by SECCM, the performance of the native oxide film over a bare metal base has been probed. Underlying Ni grain orientation matched to differences in the tendency of the NiO oxide film to break down at a particular Ni dissolution potential (Figure ). As verified by co-located ToF-SIMS imaging, it was shown that locations with thinner oxide film werecounterintuitivelymore resistant to breakdown. The results were explained and supported by a model that drew on classical nucleation theory. Combining both direct and alternating current polarization, single-crystal Mg corrosion was probed at the microscale. Electrochemical impedance spectra were acquired at confined areas across the Mg sample surface and a distribution of relaxation time analysis revealed timedependent interface processes. In a work that covers corrosion in archaeological artefacts, purposefully prepared Ag-Cu alloy samples were studied in a variety of neutral solutions of different ion species. Localized electrochemical examination, across the alloy grain boundaries and general inhomogeneities, shed light onto the intergranular corrosion mechanism that would affect ancient artefacts of similar composition.",
  "In line with previous work, elevated temperature can increase RAOM diffusion coefficients and electrochemical rate constants, and decrease cell ohmic ASR, all of which contribute to lowering overpotential losses. Of the anthraquinone negolytes studied, all demonstrate negative temperature derivatives of formal reduction potentials, thus indicating that a small increase in cell voltage can be achieved at elevated temperature with an appropriately chosen posolyte. Finally, diminution of the electrochemical kinetic stability window of the aqueous solvent with temperature suggests that temperature selection for an AORFB system will involve the optimization of RAOM and solvent stability, cell voltage, and overpotentials.",

DimeNetPP exhibits elevated errors in predicting molecules marked by higher Chi indices, specifically Chi3v. The index order signifies the graph edges within the corresponding subgraph, with the subscript 'v' denoting its valence nature, which is established based on valence delta values. Conversely, SWANI encounters increased errors in predicting molecules associated with higher BertzCT 60 values, a topological index reflecting complexity and escalating with augmented atom numbers, atom types, and bond types.

  "Overall, we observe that angular RCs and energy landscapes differ significantly between Fe and V systems, likely due to the differences in spin states for HS quintet Fe(IV)=O and LS doublet V(IV)=O intermediates, suggesting that observations of an isomer in a crystal structure with the vanadyl mimic may not be reflective of the favored intermediate structure during catalysis. Our observations also suggest that hydrogen atom transfer to form the metal-hydroxo alters isomer stability in a fashion for Fe that also cannot be captured by V mimics of this intermediate. This highlights the limits of using LS/IS vanadium-based intermediates as mimics in experimental studies of fleeting HS iron intermediates in non-heme iron enzymes.",

  "As previously we analyzed top 100 compounds from each run with best docking scores and which bind to the hinge region (Figure ). The greedy selection resulted in the highest docking scores while SA scores were comparable to outputs of the clustering strategy. The Pareto selection resulted in docking scores comparable to the clustering approach, but synthetic complexity of generated compounds was somewhat greater.",
  "The .mgf file exported from MZmine3 was also annotated by spectral matching against an insilico database to obtain putative annotations . The resulting annotations were subjected to taxonomically informed metabolite scoring (, v 2.8.2) and re-ranking from the chemotaxonomic information available on LOTUS . The in-silico database used for this process includes the combined records of the Dictionary of Natural Products (DNP, v30.2)",
  "For both the hybrid and double-hybrid methods, RS (dashdotted lines) greatly improves the calculated D e and r e which is unsurprising given the importance of long-range Fock exchange for describing CT excitations. However, with the exception of CAM-B3LYP, this results in an over-correction that leads to overbinding. Nonetheless, the lowest absolute error is given by ωB88PP86 which over-estimates D e by 1.20 kcal mol -1 (2% error).",
  "shows NEXTorch took many iterations at a concentration of 0.010 mol/l for 11, while FlowBO had more exploration at 11 and found three optimal results at three different concentrations (Table ). On the other hand, TSEMO had a lower search coverage of concentrations than FlowBO, which led to suboptimal results in the conversion.",
  "To simulate thermal relaxation following LIESST, we initialize the system in the all-HS state and equilibrate at 10 K before raising the temperature from 10 K to 500 K in steps of ∆T . We take T LIESST as the lowest temperature when γ HS = 1/2 in this simulation. Again we show the results of these simulations for two dierent heating/cooling rates in gure 14.",
  "Upon deriving the Poisson-Boltzmann distributed ion concentration, a boundary condition for electrostatic potential was chosen as to approach zero in the bulk liquid phase. This provides a very convenient reference electrode corresponding to electrons solvated in the electrolyte. To appreciate this, one can consider the definition of the absolute electrode potential by Trasatti 67",
  "In order to confirm or exclude these differences in the photoactivation mechanism of the two types of bacteriophytochromes, we have compared Agp2 and DrBph by using the same multiscale strategy. Such a strategy, outlined in Fig. , integrates ground-state (QM/) MM molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and excited-state QM/MM nonadiabatic dynamics with enhanced sampling techniques.",
  "Providing the increasingly accurate model predictions, we initiated an exploitation AL cycle by having the model greedily select F MRI agents with potentially high performance (batch 8). The batch of 30 samples included 15 copolymers with an SNR over 80 and two that exceeded the values of the highest performing copolymers reported in our previous study. The batch also included 11 samples that were insoluble, which represented a significant improvement over the attempt at exploitation prior to model development in the larger compositional space. Overall, this hierarchical AL model development workflow produced a robust model to predict the structureperformance relationships of 47,854 potential copolymer F MRI agents while experimentally exploring < 0.9% of compositional space (397 copolymers).",
  "The reaction profiles at different frequencies should thus collapse on the same curve if plotted against the energy dose received. Such a behaviour of the observed reaction profiles provides further support for our model reaction to be a purely mechanically activated process where impacts, i.e. the impulsive transfers of mechanical energy from the ball to the powder, drive the mechanochemical transformation.",
  "2. Scattering at incident energies above the resonance: in this case, we consider vibrationally hot resonance state and scale the FCF intensities accordingly. We consider two limiting cases: when the excess energy is thermalized (and the vibrational levels are populated according to the Boltzmann populations) and when no thermalization occurs so that all accessible excited vibrational levels are equally populated.",
  "For harmonic free energy corrections, vibrational frequencies were obtained at the DFT level via finitedifference Hessians of the adsorbates in the initial and transition state geometries. Since vibrational frequencies are more sensitive to the convergence of geometry optimizations than total energies, ground state geometries were tightly converged to maximum force norms of 0.01 eV/ Å. The CI-NEB transition state geometries were refined using the iterative Hessian diagonalization algorithm implemented in the Sella package.",
  "An electron-ion coincidence measurement is also handled by the CoboldPC software and the HPTDC8 acquisition board. For this, the following changes need to be implemented in the basic ions-only acquisition: (i) triggering the acquisition by electron signals while reducing the delay in extraction pulse generation, (ii) recording the electron position signals, and (iii) providing and identifying the \"false coincidence\" triggers. These are implemented as follows:",
  "When we ran the S 1 geometry optimization (shown in Figure ) we observed a barrierless path to a structure that closely resembles our intermediate containing two aromatic rings, INT 2 . In essence, the price for disturbing the double allene structure is pre-paid by the π -π * excitation, after which the system easily crosses \"above\" the transition state of the first reaction step. In this region, the S 0 and S 1 surfaces become nearly degenerate.",
  "Samples for STEM analysis were prepared using a Thermo Fisher Scientific Helios NanoLab 460F1 FIB-SEM , with a final milling energy of 2 KeV. The same microscope was also used for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging of dewetted Ni films. Select liftouts were further polished using a Fischione Model 1040 NanoMill, with a final polishing energy of 500 eV.",
  "Considering practical aspects, solid phases must be processable to form a stable film, and fast diffusion of target molecules. This design guarantees the homogenous distribution of fillers without struggling with their agglomerations. As a proof of concept, the MOP-based PNMs were fabricated by linking MOPs to generate large pores accessible to PPCP molecules. Their microextraction performance was evaluated for 13 PPCPs in different water matrices at trace-level concentrations, showing enhanced capacity and tunable selectivity towards specific pharmaceutical drugs.",
  "To assess quantication performance, we compare the solutions' emission estimates in NR conditions to estimates when ChRs were occurring. This analysis assumes the site-level emission estimate (zero or non-zero) during NR periods represents the baseline operational emissions at the site and any ChR represents an incremental emission source which the solution should detect. For a conservative analysis, the BL was reset for each ChR using the most recent available NR data from the solution. Relative error, ϵ, for solution i during a ChR at site j was dened as:",
  "Although current regulatory-approved methods for LDAR programs, such as EPA method 21 and OGI camera surveys , can provide precise component-or equipment unit-level measurements, they can be expensive and labor-intensive when scaled over thousands of O&G facilities. Also, studies have shown that emissions exhibit spatial and temporal variability , , , making it challenging to estimate the size of emissions in a facility accurately from surveys. More studies show that super emitters (emitters greater than 100 kg hr -1 : ) skew the emissions distribution , , , .",
  "The application of electrosynthesis proposes overcomingsome limitations of the directed C-H functionalizations. For example, in molecules containing nitrogen or sulphur that will coordinate strongly with metallic catalysts, possibly poisoning the catalyst or functionalizing C-H in an unwanted position . The use of electrosynthesis provides greater control of the reaction medium by electrical voltage, allowing the acceleration or stabilization of synthetic intermediates.",
  "Thus, we developed an alternate set of conditions using 4-t-butylcyclohexanone as a substrate. Specifically, 1,2-addition reaction using TMSCF3 and stoichiometric TBAF and catalytic AIBN afforded 49% of the desired Ar-CF3 product (Entry 3.1) , and increasing the loading of NBS to 3 equiv. afforded 96% yield of the desired product (Entry",

  "For cell chemistries using high potential layered compounds, including Ni-rich NMC, capacity rollovers were reported and the origin was ascribed to the release of damaging agents from the positive electrode that disrupt the negative interface . Before assuming any cross-talking phenomenon, one must first ensure that instability does not originate from the material itself (Figure ). For that, high LAM associated with a drop of the same magnitude for all peak intensities in dQ/dV during ICA would indicate a loss of mechanical properties due to particle grinding. On the other hand, (dis)appearance of a sole peak in dQ/dV can either originate from a continuous IR hindering Li intercalation at a given phase transition or an",
  "Aggregation formation is a well-known natural process causing fluorescence quenching in traditional fluorophores, which therefore became a stumbling block for their practical applications. Our group firstly reported an opposite phenomenon in 2001 called aggregationinduced emission (AIE). AIE luminogens are faintly emissive in solutions but show intense emission enhancement upon aggregation formation. Since TPE is a representative AIE-active moiety, the polymers obtained in this work are anticipated to be AIE-active. Thus, their photophysical properties are systematically investigated.",
  "However, advantages of the lower runtime of the active site model (25% faster) include the faster convergence of the GP optimization as well as the increased number of sampled ligands with high predicted pIC50 in any time interval (cf.

  "Single crystal X-ray diffraction data was collected at 150(2) K on a Rigaku XtaLAB Synergy R diffractometer equipped with a graphite monochromator (λMo-Kα = 0.71073 Å) of a micro-focus sealed X-ray source (50 kV, 24.0 mA). Data collection and reduction were performed using the CrysAlisPro software package and structure solution and refinement were carried out with SHELXT 2018/2 and SHELXL-2019/3 via Olex2 v1.5. All the non-hydrogen atoms (including those disordered) were anisotropically refined.",
  "The interaction between lead carbonate and TripolyP may be regulated by the formation of bidentate or tridentate complexes with ionized terminal PO3 -or when the middle phosphate group is also bound . This is seen via the vibration bands at 1108-1115 and 1205 cm -1 27 respectively (Figure ). However, IR spectra suggest that not all phosphate groups were bound to the lead surface, as indicated by the presence of unbound P2O7 (967-975 cm -1 ) possibly allowing for further lead complexation.",
  "Despite the multitude of conformers, it is sometimes assumed that the global minimum energy conformer sufficiently represents all inherent structures. This assumption becomes problematic at elevated temperatures, where close-packed crystal-like structures become entropically unfavorable. Another frequently employed approximation involves treating intrabasin vibrational motion as harmonic oscillation. However, as temperature rises, vibrational excursions away from the minimum intensify, leading to increasingly anharmonic motion.",
  "An advance on reflectron-ToF mass spectrometry has been the development of multi-reflection analyzers that generate a much longer, folded ion path allowing for much higher achievable resolving power . Particularly relevant to is the recently described Astral™ analyzer , which compresses a 30 m ion path onto a tabletop sized analyzer, and into which the detector developments described here were integrated. The order of magnitude longer ion path relaxes the overwhelming requirement for sub-nanosecond detector response and allows some sacrifice of single-ion pulse width in return for the implementation of other beneficial technologies such as an optically coupled PMT and signal pre-amplification.",

  "R can be qualitatively thought of as varying the steric bulk of the blocking group, while A allows that blocking group to associate with the green macrocycle to form a stabilized complex. Such strategies to experimentally introduce a power stroke in the motor have been previously proposed and are here explicitly built into simulated numerical experiments. Note that introducing power strokes in this way does not imply the presence of a mechanical strain in the molecular structure.",

Finite size of the ions is included to account for steric effects and avoid unphysically large ion concentrations near the electrode surface which can also be seen as formation of the Stern layer due to specific adsorption.

These studies are in concert with investigations by our lab on improving the chemical descriptors and ranking schemes, integrating machine learning into the workflow, and expanding into automated QM/MM modeling construction. A forthcoming publication will describe the RINRUS software package and include thorough tutorials. Public availability and adoption of RINRUS will substantially reducing learning curves for new practitioners of QMcluster modeling and initiate a feedback loop for improving the generalizability of RINRUS for constructing QM-models of proteins beyond COMT and the enzymes studied within our lab.",

  "Experimental Methods. Samples were synthesised by applying a solution-based slow crystallisation method with details about precursors, concentrations, etc. in the supporting information. Pressure-dependent powder X-ray diffraction patterns in the range from ambient pressure to 0.4 GPa were collected using the pressure jump-cell.

  "In the Figure The D3 band is slightly shifted. However, as it has been previously told by Yuan and Mayanovic, 2017, when the fitting curves are different, differences arise. In the case of the q-Gaussians, the shift is small but exists, being GauLor and q-Gau two different models of line shape. In any case, further considerations about statistics beyond the models seem being relevant. For what concerns the computation with q-Gaussians, the choice of the frequency threshold for GauLor in the best fitting on experimental data, is substituted by the choice of the q Tsallis parameter. Computational times seem therefore being comparable.",
  "Nonetheless, the reliability of result interpretation highly depends on the present structures, the zone axis, and imaging parameters. In the [111] zone axis, identifying (partially) ordered crystallites was straightforward because the superstructure Bragg disks are visible at the imaging parameters used in this study. The mere phase identification is less straightforward in certain other cases. Figure includes the results for a twinned Pt-Cu nanoparticle in the [110] zone axis.",

The sources for Reaxys-JMC were extracted from the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry between the years 2000 to 2020 as deposited in the Reaxys database . The two datasets contained complete routes and could therefore be used to construct ground truth data for multistep retrosynthesis. Ground truth routes were constructed by first grouping by citation and then creating reaction networks from which routes could be extracted with a depth first search .",
  "As there is no representation of gas or lipid diffusion towards the expanding interface in this model, or any kinetic limitation this might impose on bubble growth or shrinkage, the timescales over which these dynamics manifest are largely arbitrary and not representative of a chemically realistic system.

  "MRChem 173 is a C++ program that also relies on multiresolution adaptive grids for Hartree-Fock and density functional calculations of molecules; its specialty is the computation of magnetic properties such as nuclear magnetic shielding constants. Although the main focus of our review is on selfcontained packages for quantum electronic structure calculations for computational chemistry education, this narrow scope risks not seeing the forest from the trees. The major part of FOSS-the forest in the analogyis a huge thriving ecosystem of small projects with limited scope, which wildly outnumber the more conspicuous large program packages-the trees-which exist in synergy with the smaller projects: the smaller subprojects are often used by the larger programs. Thereby, in order to gain a thorough overview of FOSS it is invaluable to extend our review from the self-contained packages reviewed above to projects of a more limited scope which often have little user visibility.",
  "Generally, both ∆E form,ij,Si and E form,ij,T correlate with E ij,T (Figure ), albeit with some scatter. This correlation initially indicates that the rankings these metrics produce will be similar. If the thermodynamics of the net transformation during zeolite synthesis determines the final phase produced, then it is possible that E ij,T closely matches the total transformation energy and, thus, produces relatively high literature recall.",
  "In order to further probe this lack of correlation between structural and electrochemical transients, analogous transient spectroelectrochemical experiments were carried out. Operando transmission UV-vis-NIR spectra were collected during transient potential steps (Figure ).

  "RFR models lacking feature selection had RMSEs 4 to 5 weeks larger than the Boruta + RFR Full model, underscoring the benefit of feature selection and variable reduction (Table ). Certain machine learning algorithms exhibit a performance decline in situations with many irrelevant or highly correlated variables . By using a feature selection tool like Boruta, all relevant variables are selected, providing a greater understanding of the changing fluorescence in EEMs, despite some redundancy (Table ) . For example, several wavelength pairs from the FOX region of EEM1, which were overshadowed by TRP emission and missed by the EEM1 PARAFAC deconvolution, were selected as important features (Table ).",
  "After cycling, if the surface phase on LNO is nominally NiOxHy, the introduction of trace Fe impurities into rigorously Fe-free KOH electrolyte should increase OER activity via the formation of NiFeOxHy .

  "This might be due to a lack of time or knowledge regarding further functions. In any case, the students only used the features necessary for the documentation of the ferrocene synthesis. This observation 305 coincides with the comments given by the students on the other two questions about wished and needed improvements (see Table , entries 22 and 25). Some of those wishes were already available within the software during the lab course, e.g. inserting structures using SMILES codes, adding prestored molecules, specifying coordination bonds, or searching for structures via text input, only the students were apparently not aware of them.

  "The method employs a well-balanced, near-minimal min+s NAO basis set, which leads to significant savings in terms of computational cost and memory demand, compared to fully converged calculations. In order to address the systematic overestimation of bond lengths caused by basis set incompleteness, a minimally-invasive pairwise correction is used. The resulting method reliably provides accurate equilibrium volumes for monoand poly-elemental crystals in diverse bonding situations. Despite focusing on equilibrium structures for the parameterization, PBE/min+s/LPC does not deteriorate the quality of the baseline method when out of equilibrium (e.g. for distorted structures or in MD simulations). While the proposed method is geared towards use in the FHI-aims code, the underlying concepts could easily be transferred to other codes using atom centered basis functions.",

  "To access spiroindimicin D (4), a chemoselective reduction of the oxindole of 36 to an indoline in the presence of the two esters was required. After screening potential solutions, we found that the desired transformation could be achieved under Dixon's conditions, involving Ir-catalyzed hydrosilylation to an intermediate O-silyl hemiaminal followed by its reduction with NaBH3CN in the same pot, affording spiroindimicin D (4) in 73% yield.

  "Our results show that Fe incorporates at surface sites at constant OER potentials and mixes into the interior only after cycling. The number of surface-adsorbed Fe sites can be controlled by stopping the CA experiment at different times while Fe is accumulating on the NiOxHy or CoOxHy, thus providing the first known route to create and study specific types of Fe sites in these important materials. The TOFFe increases until maximum Fe adsorption and OER current at 5.1 at.% Fe on NiOxHy and the incredibly high TOFFe of 10.4 ± 1.4 s -1 at η = 300 mV. This data shows that each Fe-based-site becomes more OER active as surface-absorbed Fe sites accumulate.",
  "The temperature was imposed using the canonical sampling through velocity rescaling thermostat with a time constant of 100 fs. Hydrogen was replaced by deuterium to avoid artificial bond breaking due to the fast motion of H. The AIMD time steps were chosen as 1 fs.

  "The contribution of aromatic OS structure with the quinoidal CS resonance form was analyzed using the biradical character index (𝑦 0 ) according to the Yamaguchi's scheme. In addition, we used the fractional occupation number weighted density (FOD) method to quantitatively describe the OS singlet biradical character. FOD analysis was performed with the default values implemented in ORCA 4.1.2 (TPSS/def2-TZVPP; Tel = 5000K).

  "Despite being known for over 40 years and commanding healthy interest from synthetic chemists, including successful preparations of related spiroisoxazoline alkaloids, no total synthesis of any psammaplysin had been achieved until 2022. During the course of our studies, the Magauer group disclosed the first synthesis of racemic psammaplysin A (1) in 13 steps (Figure ). Their route centered upon the use of a Henry reaction/cyclization/reduction to prepare the spiroisoxazoline ketone 8. Subsequent Baeyer-Villiger oxidation expanded the 6membered ketone to 7-membered lactone 9, which through further oxidation state adjustment led to the fully functionalized 5/7spirocycle. A final coupling with a tyraminederived amine led to 1. One additional advanced study by the Yang group appeared in 2022 that is relevant to the present work. These authors reported the synthesis of nonnatural deoxypsammaplysins K (13) and O (14), which lack the C-7 hydroxyl unit, via a route that centered on a key [3+2] dipolar",
  "Our recently proposed dispersion-corrected MP2D model 49 addresses both limitations. MP2D adopts the same basic formalism as MP2C, but it computes the UCHF and CKS dispersion contributions according to Grimme's D3 strategy, which estimates the atomcentered dispersion coefficients via interpolation among pre-tabulated reference values for each element in different coordination environments. The D3 dispersion correction can be computed with trivial force-field like cost, is readily differentiated for analytic nuclear gradients, and is applicable to both intra-and intermolecular interactions.",
  "NU-1000 -the pyrene-based analogue of PCN-222undergoes a local distortion of the Zr 6 (OH) 4 O 4 cluster above 373 K, which persists for weeks before relaxing to the undistorted structure. To investigate whether PCN-222 exhibits similar behaviour, pair distribution function (PDF) analysis of PCN-222 at various temperatures was carried out [Fig. ]. While a small distortion occurs upon heating, this is reversible and we can rule out that local cluster distortions account for the thermal behaviour upon cooling.",
  "Interestingly, we find consistent agreement regarding one material property of undoped Pb 1-x Sn x Te: the weighted mobility µ w . By calculating µ w from the measured electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient 66 across different studies, we find that it reaches a minimum near x ≈ 0.6 at room temperature (Figure ). Given that the alloy reaches a semimetallic state near this composition and semimetals typically exhibit low µ w , it is reasonable to say that the minimal µ w is attributable to the topological transition. Since the band structure evolution through the topological transition can be captured by a k • p band structure model, modeling TE properties using an adapted transport model may help understand the origin of the weighted mobility trend.",

SAPT0 is the most computationally efficient SAPT level, particularly in its density-fitted implementation, and it has a cost similar to DF-MP2.

  "Traditionally, ERI screening algorithms are based on the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, however, in recent years more efficient bounds were developed, e.g. by using multipole expansions. While most development of integral bounds focuses on ERIs, Thompson and Ochsenfeld recently proposed a rather general bound formalism, applicable to various one-and multielectron integrals, based on space partitioning. Another type of integrals leading to steep computational scaling are effective core potential (ECP) overlap integrals, due to them containing spherical projectors. Over the last years a few screening procedures were developed for ECPs. are needed to calculate the GOSTSHYP gradient, we found it the natural choice to use the these bounds for mid-center GTOs with arbitrary angular momentum using the Obara-Saika recurrence relations (RRs). This allows us to reduce the scaling of GOSTSHYP to O(n tess ).",

  "In this study, fluorescence and absorbance measurements were used to track NOM characteristics within a non-disinfected DWDS from different groundwater sources up to the consumers taps throughout a year. While two of the three monitored groundwater sources were characterized by mostly stable NOM characteristics, a significant variability was found in one of the sources likely due to the combination of changes in DWTPs operations and other groundwater abstractions and recharges. Water treatment affected NOM presence differently between chromophoric and humiclike and protein-like fractions. One DWTP, equipped with a rapid sand filter, provided only a limited reduction of high molecular weight compounds, without affecting fluorescent compounds.",

  "Engineering high-performing MOFs for a desired application involves searching the vast configuration space of metal nodes, linkers and ligands. Among the large list of redoxactive ligands used to promote conductivity in porous frameworks, dihydroxybenzoquinone (dhbq) and its derivatives stand promising to engender mixed-valence MOFs due to their ability to exist in three different redox states through aromatic-quionid-aromatic transitions (Figure ) . The 3 -charge state is a radical and thus carries a spin compared to the diamagnetic 2 -and 4 -states. The π * -orbitals of the ligand are energetically matched with transition metal 3d-orbitals, enabling effective metal-ligand coordination and long-range conjugated pathways along the framework struts for efficient charge transport .",

  "Chong, Gritsenko, and Baerends 11 have made numerical and theoretical arguments for an approximate equality, that is closer for ionization from valence levels than from core levels. Bartlett, Lotrich, and Schweigert have given a formal argument for an equality, based on a time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT): Let the electron be removed from an initially occupied orbital i and moved to an initially unoccupied orbital a. Then, as a approaches the top of the Rydberg series (ϵ a = 0), the matrix elements that additively correct the orbital energy difference ϵ a -ϵ i tend to zero. In the Appendix, we argue that, in a careful treatment of the correction from continuum or unbound Kohn-Sham orbitals, the correction itself need not vanish.",

  "The latter can be recovered exploiting the Crooks theorem on the forward and reverse work distributions, or using the Jarzynski identity The work distribution can hence be seen as the fingerprint of the initial canonical sampling, blurred by the dissipation of the process defined as W diss = W -∆G. The latter grows linearly with the speed of the process and depends noticeably on the selected alchemical protocol. In our case, provided that the molecules have similar volumes, thanks to the COM-COM restraint, the growth process occurs with basically little resistance (i.e. small dissipation) in an \"empty\" region occupied by the (unperceived) annihilating partner. Therefore, NE-RBFE is not equivalent to two NE-ABFE calculations. The variance or dissipation in the DT NE-alchemical process is in general much less than the sum of the variance of the annihilation and growth processes combined (see Figure in the SI).",

  "Based on the MH24 model, four functionals have been developed by choosing different parameter and reference training sets for the optimization. In particular, the real-space separation in the cat-LMF provides a direct connection between the nine empirical parameters, distinct regions in real space and thus specific properties. In the chosen optimization scheme, this concerns core ionization potentials for the core LMF, electron affinities for the asymptotic LMF, atomization energies and transition barrier heights for the valence parameters of the functional and noble gase dimer dissociation curves for the calibration function. Choosing arbitrary weighting factors for the individual properties has been circumvented by using a super-self-consistent-field approach.",

Even though NO3 -plays as both template and assistant for ligand exchange, the [Pd614] 12+ SP was not produced quantitatively with NO3 -because its strong assist effect led the system to thermodynamic equilibrium.",
  "WelO5 contains only one dominant, directional substrate-protein interaction, the 12-epifischerindole U can more flexibly orient in the active site. This flexibility affords the substrate the capability to reorient from the crystal structure position to the experimentally motivated position in both the eq-O and ax-Cl configurational isomers. In contrast for BesD, the small Lys substrate forms numerous charge-assisted HBs with the protein environment, acting both as an HB donor and acceptor via its carboxylate and amine functional groups respectively (Figure and Supporting Information Table ). This QM analysis, which represents the first QM modeling of the BesD active site and essential protein residues, indicates that these HBs cumulatively stabilize the Lys substrate by 32-51 kcal/mol depending on the isomer (Figure ).",
  "This normal mode involves antisymmetric C-C stretches of the center ring coupled to the motion of the dimethyl amine groups. Because the LR-TD-B3LYP S 1 minimum is not of C 2v symmetry, contrary to other methods, this symmetry breaking leads to enhanced coupling with the anti-symmetric stretch, giving rise to the large peak in spectral density. We further analyze this normal mode in the following section.",

  "The exploration of the energy landscapes is based on the computational potential energy landscape framework, employing discrete pathsampling (DPS) to derive kinetic transition networks. Low energy minima to initiate the landscape explorations were located using basin-hopping global optimisation For both potentials, searches were initiated from sequence and from the available PDB entry (2G1W). Transition state candidates were located with the doubly-nudged elastic band (DNEB) algorithm, employing the quasi-continuous interpolation (QCI) scheme.

Our results demonstrate that the encoder-predictor neural network exhibits excellent prediction accuracy which is more precise than several DFT calculations with SMx and SMD implicit solvent models, 2 while the MLP model without recurrent layers shows relatively deficient performances. The score matrix taken from the attention mechanism gives us an interaction map between atoms and substructure; our model does provide not only a simple estimation of target property but offers pieces of information about which substructures are play a dominant role in solvation processes.

  "In LSDA, the exchange-correlation energy density e xc depends only on the spin densities n ↑ and n ↓ ; the GGA further depends on their gradients; and the meta-GGA further depends on the local kinetic energy spin-densities. As a function of fractional electron number N , the energy of a semilocal functional bends below the exact straight-line segment. This convexity leads to delocalization error, with non-integer electron numbers on separated fragments. Hartree-Fock (HF) theory, or its analogue in Kohn-Sham theory, the exchange-only approximation, tends to bend above the straight-line condition, leading to over-localization error. 2",

The state is quite different from the bioactive conformation required for the subsequent ternary complex formation and suggests an origin for its 'hook effect' observed experimentally at relatively higher concentrations. In contrast, all PROTAC binary systems with BRD4:BD2 demonstrated high flexibilities of VH032, even though such VHL warhead could tangle with opened ZA loop in some states according to extensive simulations. In summary, this research expands our understanding of the potential risks and benefits of conformational control, linker rigidification and hydrophobicity in PROTAC drug discovery for targeted protein degradation (TPD). Although constraining PROTAC linker freedom has been widely considered as an efficient strategy to improve the permeability through 'hydrophobic collapse' and facilitate the final formation of ternary complex regarding entropy in some systems, this study highlights the importance of balancing this with considera-",

To assess stress relaxation timescales, the Kohlrausch's stretched-exponential relaxation model was used to fit the data, as it has been used for many viscoelastic polymer materials. A timescale τ SR was determined by using,",
  "We also think that potassium fluoride KF might deserve special attention for designing electrodes with high reversibility, especially within all solid-state FIBs. The potential for potassium insertion into carbon is at a potential similar to graphite materials used for lithiumion batteries (see Figure ). For KF + 8 C + e - KC8 + F -, the capacity would be at a reasonable value of Cgrav.theo. = 174 mAh g -1 . More remarkably, considering the molar volumes of the different reaction partners, the volume change would be as low as +/-2.5 % for changing between the charged and discharged state. Additionally, potassium and carbon have a high abundance and would not represent a limiting factor for battery manufacturing.",
  "With the AMBER and CHARMM force field families, the electrostatic interactions are primarily treated using the particle mesh Ewald (PME) approach, which needs system charge neutralization, presenting a significant constraint to its CpHMD implementations as charge fluctuates with residue titration. A straightforward approach is to add a fixed number of counter-ions to neutralize the solute's charge at a given pH, bringing the system charge fluctuations near zero. These charge fluctuations can still be corrected using a uniform neutralizing background charge without creating unwanted artifacts, 67 a method that is implemented in the GROMACS software package. There are other methods to ensure complete charge neutrality where, p.e., ions coupled to titratable sites as charge buffers, but they are not supported in GROMACS.",
  "Classical MD trajectories were simulated with the NAMD 3.0 software . The isothermal-isobaric (NPT) ensemble at P = 1 atm and T = 300 K was employed with the Nosé-Hoover Langevin piston pressure control and the Langevin dynamics. Periodic boundary conditions and the particle-mesh Ewald algorithm were enforced to model the infinitely dilute solution and account for the long-range electrostatic interaction, whereas the non-bonded interaction cut-off parameter was set to 12 Å. The integration step of 2 fs was used with the SHAKE/SETTLE algorithms applied to constrain all bonds to hydrogen atoms. A harmonic constraint potential of 0.1 kcal/Å 2 was applied to the CA atoms of the beta sheets of the protein.",
  "Fig. shows that the AARD for the PR model diminishes as the incorporation of experimental data increases, aligning with Tsai and Lin's findings . A key observation from our study is the ability of the mfp-sum Wagner EE model to significantly outperform the PR-pred method (AARD 0.617 vs 1.36), which, like our machine learning approach, does not rely on experimental data inputs. This advantage underscores the potential of machine learning in accurately predicting vapor pressures Wagner EE model achieves lower overall prediction errors.

The test center recorded the timing, emission rate, location (i.e., emission points and GPS coordinates), and gas composition of controlled releases. As with Ravikumar et al., the release schedules in this study were intentionally complicated (i.e., variation in the position and number of emission sources per experiment and the survey areas used during such experiment) not only to improve testing complexity but to minimize scenarios where gas odor provided consistent cues to surveyors during testing.",

Comparison with models trained using the same train/test split is more reliable, and the FullSSPrUCe model is trained on the larger portion of the nmrshiftdb2 database, which explains its slightly better performance. In any case, since all reported models are solvent agnostic, it is clear that the accuracy has reached its limit because it is not unusual for C shifts to differ by more than 1 ppm in different solvents.",

Given that all polymerizations targeted the same DP, the modest differences in Mn did not influence polymer F MRI agent sensitivity.",

  "Both bands number and its position are sensitive to the cation composition and substantial modifications to the bands envelope emerge as a consequence of the replacements of the ionic structure . The first insight into the low-frequency vibrational spectra is obtained from the vibrational density of states, VDOS, derived from Fourier transforming the appropriate velocity TCFs. It is worthing to mention that the bands seen in the VDOS keeps differences specially for large and complex systems, and are often poorly related to the experimental vibrational data obtained from optical spectroscopy. On figure we find the VDOS for the systems studied here. The simplest pattern is observed for the NO 3 contribution that lies in the lower frequency due to its larger molar mass with a predominant band centered at ~ 50 cm Taking the Fourier transform of the polarizability ACF in the susceptibility form, we find a more comparable data with the corresponding vibrational experimental data.",

  "Material Characterization. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out with a PANalytical Empyrean Diffractometer with Cu Kα1,2 radiations in Bragg-Brentano configuration. Diffraction patterns were collected in a 2ϑ range of 15-120°(2ϑ) with a scan step of 0.008° for a total of 20 hours of acquisition. The lattice parameters were determined using the FullProf program 1 via the full pattern matching refinement (Le Bail method). For microstructural analysis, the XRD data collected for highly crystalline LaB6 were used to model the instrumental function. Crystallite size and microstrains were calculated using the Williamson-Hall method and a description of the peak profiles by the Thomson-Cox-Hastings Pseudo-Voigt function taking into account additional anisotropic Lorentzian size and strain broadening models. Size broadening can be written as the linear combination of cubic harmonics, and strain can be modeled using a quartic form in reciprocal space following Laue class m3m.",

Prior work on WelO5 11, 54 had only considered the isomerization of the oxo moiety to the equatorial plane to attain expected substrate positioning in the active-site to favor regioselective chlorination. However, our dynamics simulations strongly suggest that a subsequent isomerization of Cl to the axial plane merits consideration to explain the observed reactivity.

  "(2) Second set of 10 host-guest systems: CD hosts. The structures for unbound α-and β-CD, alongside guest molecules were manually constructed. Guest molecules underwent vacuum-based quantum mechanics (QM) energy minimization using the HF/6-31G(d) method within Gaussian 09. Partial charges, LJ parameters, and bonded parameters were derived from Q4MD-CD force fields for CD molecules. Guest partial charges were derived using the RESP method implemented in the R.E.D. server tool , while LJ and bonded parameters were sourced from GAFF 93 v1.7. MD simulations of these systems included the host-guest complexes, TIP3P waters and additional Na + and Cl -ions for neutralization, approximat-ing the ionic strength of a 50 mM phosphate buffer used in experiments. Equilibration with positional restraints was conducted. The approach accommodated guest orientations within CD cavities using designated simulation files. Equilibration in the NPT ensemble with light positional restraints (0.1 kcal/mol/ Å2 ) on host and guest atoms was performed, and the equilibration's final conformation was retained. Unrestrained equilibration and clustering were omitted for CD sets, considering certain guest bindings might be weak enough to permit extended departures from the binding cavity. For accommodating guest's potential orientations within the CD cavity, simulation files marked with the '-p' suffix signify that the guest molecule is linked with its polar functional group positioned outward from the primary (narrow) side of the CD structure.",

  "Up to this point, the effective Hamiltonian has been discussed as separated terms, namely the linear and the bilinear operator terms. To generate efficient pulse sequences coping with specific needs in regard of bandselective or broadbandedness relative to electron spin offsets, it is relevant to consider these terms in combination. This is ascribed to the fact that linear terms not commuting with the bilinear terms effectively truncates the effect of the latter ones as touched on earlier in relation to liquid-and solid-state NMR and DNP. Taking origin in the SSV-EHT approach described above, we can readily define a figure-of-merit (FOM) function for transfer through the pseudo-secular hyperfine coupling as",
  "A natural extension is to add reaction steps leading to C2+ species, as there are, e.g., ethanol intermediates that could have similar C XPS binding energies and thus contribute to the observed high coverages of hydrocarbon species, i.e. some CHx species being CyHx allowing multiple carbons associated with a Rh atom. Another possible next step is to study the adsorbates and barriers, that needed altered energies, on edges or defects. Inclusion of such sites -even though the experiment was performed on single-crystal Rh(111) -may be justified as single-crystals can have a defect density of 1 per 20 th unit cell. The induced defect density may be particularly high under operating conditions with strongly interacting molecules, such as CO. Although not the case here at 150 mbar pressure, it has been observed previously that at a higher pressure of 2 bar undercoordinated adatoms may move from the lattice onto the surface. Furthermore, the presence of step sites and point defects has been shown to destabilize CO on Rh , in accordance with the prediction of the GA.",

  "Given our CC cycling results from DHAQ and DBEAQ cells, it is not always apparent whether uncontrolled SOC-restriction i.e, galvanostatic cycling, will provide a lower or higher temporal capacity fade rate than when the full SOC is accessed. Thus, a measure of the intrinsic property of stability of many AORFB electrolytes previously reported is often wildly unreliable. This fact deserves increased emphasis in the literature; the measurement and reporting of a key parameter affecting the cost of a decadal AORFB system has yet to be conformed to a widely adopted standard. Though there may be value in cycling AORFBs with controlled SOC-restriction, whether it be to mitigate degradation caused by water split-ting at extreme SOC or investigate SOC-dependent degradation, voltage holds should still be used, in combination with coulombic SOC-cutoffs. To characterize RAOM stability in these edge cases, it is important to periodically measure total capacity via 100% DoD cycles or via quantitative chemical analysis.",

Finally, owing to the low electron affinity of vinylidene (~0.5 eV), two mid-IR photons have enough energy to resonantly excite the anion and then detach an electron, leading to the generation of photoelectrons even in the absence of the near-IR photodetachment laser. This vibrationally-resonant two-photon detachment (VR2PD) signal manifests as additional peaks in all IR cryo-SEVI spectra whose eKE remains constant as the near-IR detachment frequency is varied. The VR2PD mechanism is also shown in Figures and.",
  "To effectively probe ion-protein interactions we selected a range of ions and ion combinations according to the two ion descriptors, polarizability and the range of the molecular electrostatic potential (MEPrange). Both have been shown to be of great importance to IL ion behaviour in solution, at surfaces, and in directly influencing reaction kinetics. Ion descriptor combinations are depicted in Figure .",
  "While Equation only applies to star polymers well dispersed in solution, recent theoretical works suggested that the quantity of arms (f) strongly correlates to the chain flexibility of neat star polymer melts (solvent free) as well, and that greater f leads to larger concentrated regime on each arm in neat star polymer melts (rc positively correlates to f ). Based on these theoretical studies, we proposed that for star polymer electrolytes with linear PEO arms to have high ionic conductivity, their particle radius (r = r0 + h) needs to exceed a certain value (rmin, Figure ), and we anticipated that rmin is also proportional to the square root of f (similar to rc):",
  "Machine learning models including Decision Tree 37 , XGBoost and RandomForest(RF) were firstly evaluated as baseline models in this study through the scikit-learn 39 package to predict band gaps. Considering that machine learning models were not able to handle unstructured data, we selected overall 21 structured crystal features. In which, density, final energy, energy above hull, fermi level, volume, number of sites, final energy per atom, and formation energy per atom were chosen to represent global features of crystals, meanwhile, mass, density, volume, atomic radii, atomic num, boil, melt, van der waals radii, covalent radii, first ionization energy, electronegativity, group, period represented atomic features of crystals.",

  "Previous studies performed by some of us on a model SN2 reaction have shown that for similar extent of the carbon-halogen bond elongation at the transition state of the SN2 reaction one may expect the carbon KIE of 1.06-1.07 49 for the anionic nucleophile. However, no linear -sform relationship between the TS structure and the magnitude of carbon (chlorine in that case) KIE was concluded by the authors.",
  "Taking 2,6-dimethyliodobenzene, 7, as substrate, palladium sources (10 mol%) were examined (Table ) in benzene, with KOtBu (2 equiv) as base, and in the absence of any other additives under the conditions used in Scheme 2. All the Pd sources (entries 2-7) engaged the substrate 7 and afforded increased yields of 8 when compared to the blank reaction (entry 1). Interestingly, biphenyl 9 was also formed in all cases in noteworthy amounts, although the ratios of 8:9 varied widely and none of the entries showed the ca. 1.0: 4.0 ratio that would be the hallmark of exclusive radical BHAS chemistry. Coupled product 8 potentially arises from coupling of the arylpalladium derivative",
  "Similar observations were reported in literature for fatty acid-esterified lignin . The slightly lower glass transition and onset temperatures for CML may be due to a partial depolymerization of lignin . The introduction of 1-metylimidazole fragment seemed to enhance hydrogen bonding in ImL and induces sheet-like structure formation. Consequent incorporation of metal nanoparticles improves the structural stability what results in appearance of remarkable glass transition peak for Lignin@Pd/CuO-NP material on the DSC curve (Figure ) and increasing Tg up to 89.9°C. The structural stabilization effect correlates well with the results of SEM imaging, where distinct uniform nanoscale structures were found.",

  "To generate the training data required for fitting our Neural Network (NN) models, we expanded the simulation box of each system based on the unit cell's expansion in various crystallographic directions (see Figure ). The force field parameters were sourced from the general AMBER force field (GAFF) , and atomic charges were determined using the restrained electrostatic potential fitting procedure (RESP) at the HF/6-31G(p, d) level of theory using Gaussian 16 software . After energy minimization, the initial structures underwent equilibration for 1 nanosecond at 500K in the NVT ensemble, employing the Nosé-Hoover thermostat .

  "As noted earlier, the RLS towards C2+ products is distinct from methane's as evidenced both by its pH-independence on the SHE scale and its higher Tafel slope. These findings suggest that the RLS is located directly after *CO. Four possible RLS would satisfy the experimental behavior, namely PCET steps onto *CO that would form either *CHO or *COH, *CO dimerization or a PCET step onto the formed *CO dimer. This shows that identifying the RLS is linked with the question when the carbons couple on the catalyst surface. In order to pin down the exact RLS several efforts have been brought forward recently.",
  "This past research introduced the use of bacterial enzymes as a potential solution in degrading PFAS but the drawbacks is the accuracy and precision when discovering enzymes with strong bind affinity to PFAS ligands as the 3D structures of dehalogenases enzymes used are uncertain.

  "We therefore chose thioesters as S-protecting groups that are wellbehaved with KSeCN (see 6→7). We refluxed 10 in MeOH with excess NaBH4 to give mercaptobutanol 11; heating was essential for full conversion of the thiolactol intermediate. The borate salts were removed by filtration, and aqueous workup gave crude 11 in 97% yield and excellent purity, which could be stored capped under air at 25°C without disulfide formation. We next devised a procedure to Smask 11 as the thioester before mesylating its alcohol, seeking controlled conditions to favour the S-ester kinetic product over the Oester thermodynamic product (that can be formed directly, or after intra/intermolecular trans-acylation). Therefore, at 0 °C, we screened equimolar amounts of acid chlorides for S-masking. Bulky BzCl and PivCl which give kinetically stable thioesters allowed rapid chemoselective S-masking; alternatively, lower temperatures, controlled stoichiometry, and short reaction times allowed unhindered AcCl to reach similar efficiency. One-pot mesylation of the alcohol was smooth, with aqueous workup giving excellently pure mesylate 13 in 77% yield, ready for selective C1-selenisation (Figure ).",

  "Literature conditions reported to chemoselectively couple aryl halides and triflates performed poorly, and is likely reflective of these challenging furopyridine substrates, which push the current methodologies for Pd-catalyzed reactions to their limits. Initial attempts to couple the bromine afforded only starting material. Changing to higher boiling non-polar solvents, with accompanying increases in temperature did produce low yields of product. The most successful condition employed xylene at 170 ºC, but only afforded the isolated product in 36% yield. Longer reaction times may have improved the yield but running reactions at 170 ºC for over 24 hours did not meet our goal of a practical synthesis.",

  "Starting from a 6-coordinated Al monomer, metaD reveals two different pathways for monomer detachment from the zigzag edge; in one reaction pathway the Al monomer is 6-coordinated before any Al-OH bridge bonds are broken and in the second reaction pathway an H 2 O leaves the first coordination shell of the Al and the Al monomer detaches as a 5-coordinate species. Similar Al sites have been also reported on gibbsite (100) edge surface of AIMD simulations . There are thus two initial coordination environments for the Al during the monomer desorption.",

  "The background dimensionality of the raw DEER time traces was also adjusted carefully to extract additional qualitative information. A typical value of D = 3.74 could be used for HSA at lower incubation temperatures (T < 40 C). As this parameter is sensitive to changes in global shape and excluded volume, successful analyses of available DEER data are only possible when dimensionality is adjusted between 3.0 and 3.7 for temperature between 40 °C and 70 °C. Besides the sharp dimensionality drop beyond T D,2 (D < 3), indicating transition to more linearly stretched albumin polypeptide chains, data evaluation is strongly hampered and proper spin echo formation vanishes, likely due to denatured protein in gel-like fractions (see also Figures and). Inhomogeneous vitrification due to protein denaturation from incubations above 81 °C render DEER experiments increasingly inaccessible.

  "The inability to recover high accuracy in both limiting situations with a single regularization parameter shows that limitations of OOMP2 cannot be fully overcome by regularization based only on orbital energy denominators.

The latter indicates why nFRET appears to be underestimated when considering the near-complete energy transfer apparent from the HF-OLED spectra, i.e. small contribution from the sensitiser to the EL spectrum. As mentioned above, ISC/rISC cycling can depopulated and repopulate the singlet state (potentially multiple times) before emitting, and FRET will also occur during the DF/triplet regime. The calculated nFRET from the PF decays represents the probability of FRET without considering these cycling events, rather than the larger cumulative nFRET over the entire exciton lifetime.",
  "TOC: Strong D-A conjugated phosphoniums of PHCs and PDCs have been described firstly using the radical-directive topology synthesis, which contain phospha [5]helication and phospha [6]dication species. In this paper, an atomically precise Mn(III) halide has been unprecedentedly captured and determined for the C-P bond activation. These D-A pairs show unique topology dependence on the optoelectronic properties due to the dissymmetry of molecular polarity, i.e. extreme HLCT-induced solvatochromic luminescence (Δλem up to 0.78 eV), co-assembly driven CPL (glum up to 1.8 × 10 -3 ), and high diradical character (y0 = 0.989).",
  "All simulations were conducted under the periodic boundary conditions with Particle-Mesh Ewald method (PME) utilized to treat long-range electrostatic interactions. The cutoff for both short-range electrostatic and van der Waals was set to be 8 Å. A 2 fs time step was applied here with SHAKE algorithm 66 used to constrain bonds involving hydrogen.",
  "In conclusion, we have accomplished the concise synthesis of fortuneicyclidin A (5) and B (6) in 8 steps, and cephalotine B (8) in 9 steps from the commercially available compounds. This study clearly shows that convergent dearomative spirocyclization and the design of tandem cyclization offers rapid construction of the key tetracyclic skeleton. Moreover, two catalytic hydrosilylations at a late stage of the synthesis achieved chemoselective carbonyl transformations, minimizing protecting group manipulations. This synthesis is yet another example demonstrating that appropriate use of tandem reaction methodology can enable for the rapid synthesis of complex molecular skeletons. 28",
  "Figure : MD model building workflow used to polymerize in ReaxFF. The molecules were initialized in ChemDraw 3D, then transformed into LAMMPS and mixed in a specific molar ratio, then the simulation cells were replicated and compressed to reach a density of 1.13 gm/cm 3 , then polymerized with a heatingholding-cooling-equilibration cycle repeated 5 times, and finally the simulated structure was relaxed.",
  "An additional strength of the method described here is that it can assist in deconvolution of species from MS1 data; for instance, the neutral loss of the acetate ion of PC produces species which are isobaric with PE species with two fewer carbons in the aggregate acyl chain. This fragmentation also occurs in-source, which would complicate identification of compounds from MS-Only data if IC-RTC was not used.",
  "The recent EPA's final rule has stipulated the performance CM solutions must meet to be approved as an alternative approach for regulatory LDAR programs. According to subpart OOOOb 40 CFR part 60 by EPA , the detection threshold for CM systems must be at least 0.4 kg hr -1 of CH4. While operators are already using CM solutions for internal emissions accounting programs and voluntary methane emissions reduction programs like OGMP 2.0 , more rigorous testing is needed to improve confidence in output data (such as 90% DL, quantification accuracy, detection, and localization) and track the trend in solutions' performance over time.",

  "Integration of digitalization and research data management into curricula is one of the current challenges in academic education. This vastly underrepresented content is highly relevant for 400 students' careers, but densely packed curricula leave little opportunity for its sustained inclusion. This publication shows the integration of RDM into existing concepts as an initial example in chemistry studies by the implementation of the electronic laboratory notebook Chemotion ELN into an advanced inorganic lab course for upper-division undergraduate students accompanied by general learning materials on the topic. The general teaching concepts are shown and discussed here. In addition,",
  "Subsequently, 5, 6 and 8 were detected only after 24 hours. Likewise, enantiopurity was examined for all samples at time intervals shown in figure , which reveals a firm increase of ee during the whole process confirming amplification of chirality. Again, the figure shows an early and significant rise of handedness with a first recording at 34% ee after 7h of reaction and very low conversion. Asymmetric amplification of 2 increased less gently to a maximum of 59% ee for 20 % of alkanol 2. Naturally the deficiency in iPr2Zn caused a very low conversion and consequently limited amplification of chirality. Notably, the perceived behaviour is not unique to the present study and adheres to a trend described in our preceding reports.",
  "Other neural network models such as SHIFTX+ have been further put to the test beyond their traditional role in predicting chemical shifts for individual structures. Several studies suggest that dynamically averaged NMR chemical shifts obtained through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations show substantial improvements when compared to individual structures , even highlighting a noteworthy alignment with experimental chemical shifts. Yet, it is crucial to highlight that not every method designed for predicting chemical shifts is suitable for MD datasets.",
  "For gas control optimization, the on-chip gassing performance was simulated using computational fluid dynamics with experimentally determined gas-inflow concentration profiles resulting from interconnected mass flow controllers. Therefore, the O 2 concentration was measured inside the supply tubing outlet under different gas-supply flow rates (100, 300, 600 mL/min), when no chip was installed (Fig. ). This was necessary because likely dead volumes in the mass flow controller setup were affecting the resulting switching performance, mostly when O T', as shown in Fig. . These device characterization results ensure a fast gas exchange in the order of seconds in the developed microfluidic device.",

  "The link between the QC and MM descriptions of a molecular system can be established at different levels. Here, we will show that QC atomic charges and bond orders together with optimized geometries and harmonic force constants can be employed to develop MM models closely approaching the underlying QC accuracy, without additional computational cost after the initial reparameterization. While several recent attempts have been done in this direction, the present contribution defines a unique fully consistent model avoiding any inconsistency and implemented in a user friendly tool (referred to as SmartField), which can be linked to different electronic structure codes in order to perform fully unsupervised FF parametrizations and (in conjunction with our new MD engine within the Gaussian code) time dependent simulations.",
  "There is some mixing of states, so that the CT states acquire small oscillator strengths and the exciton states have partial CT character. While the stabilization of the special pair CT states is relatively modest, the degree of mixing between the exciton and CT states depends sensitively on their energetic separation. The CT character of the lowest excitonic adiabatic states is therefore affected by the inclusion of electronic polarization, seen as the increase of the permanent dipole moment of the P * states from gas phase to QM/MM-IEDRF.",

The charge density difference is given by the formula:",
  "The natural population analysis shows that the CT character of S 1 in the crystal and solution are similar for the three systems (Fig. and Table ). The donor character of Cz in hybrid crystals is already known and it has been exploited to boost ultralong organic phosphorescence and TADF in purely organic crystals at room temperature. Both ISC and rISC processes benefit from an increased CT character of S 1 as the energy gap between S 1 and low lying triplet states T n is reduced. Thus, the driving forces of (r)ISC are enhanced in the crystalline phase (Equation ).",
  "The density matrix, D SCF , can be constructed from the standard or approximate HF calculation, such as the DC-HF one. Before the evaluation of the subsystem correlation energy, the subsystem MOs must be classified into occupied { } , ,... . This can be accomplished by, for example, using the Fermi level determined in the prior DC-HF calculations.",
  "Theory and modeling. Density functional theory spin-polarized electronic structure calculations were carried out using the QUANTUM ESPRESSO package (v6.5). For initial geometry optimization the exchange-correlation effects were described using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional augmented by Grimme's D3 dispersion force corrections. The van der Waals density functional optB88-vdW was then adopted to refine geometric and electronic properties. The atomic cores were described using the projected augmented wave method (PAW) with the pslibrary psuedopotentials. Valence wave functions were expanded in plane wave basis set up to 650 eV energy cut off. Atomic coordinates were relaxed using the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno 43 (BFGS) algorithm until the Hellmann-Feynman forces on all atoms fell below 0.05 eV/Å. We employed a 3x3x1 G-centered Monkhorst-Pack 44 k-point integration of the Brillouin zone. The calculated lattice constant of 3.2 Å for MoS2 is close to experiment and is consistent with other theoretical calculations. To model metallocene intercalation, we use an optimized bilayer 1T'-MoS2 primitive cell to construct a rectangular 3x6x1 supercell, where the metallocene is placed in the van der Waals gap. We adopted a 15 Å vacuum space to prevent spurious interactions between the periodically repeated images. The ENVIRON module was used to model the effect of solvent interactions using the self-consistent continuum solvation (SCCS) method, whereby a dielectric constant of e0 = 78.3 was used for H2O. The electrode potential is calculated as the difference in energy between the Fermi level and the electrostatic potential in bulk implicit solvent. The electrode potential is then converted to an absolute scale by referencing to the standard hydrogen electrode, USHE = 4.11 eV.",
  "Freshly evaporated devices were transferred into a calibrated 6-inch integrating sphere (Labsphere) in a glovebox, and their electrical properties were measured using a source meter (Keithley 2400).

  "The selection of solvent and counterions is not only important for templating and charge balancing, but also for their persistent role in determining the framework structure and symmetry -making it another parameter or building block of MOF chemistry and increasing their chemical space even further . The dependence on the choice of metal also shows that some MOFs are more structurally resilient to the influence of excess counterions.",
  "The weighted accuracy results surpassed those from the strict accuracy metric with all models, consistently achieving weighted accuracies above 94% across all evaluated numbers of stereocenters (Figure ). In this case, the 2-fold augmented model only slightly outperformed the other models. Importantly, the model trained with scrambled stereochemical labels (yellow line) only achieved the levels of accuracies expected for random assignment (dashed black line), confirming again that learnable stereochemical patterns existed in the source NP dataset.",
  "Variables at the top of the tree are in general more important than variables at leaves, as bigger information gains correspond to the top splits. In ensembles of decision trees, the final importance of the variables can be averaged for all trees within the model .

It shows how much the prediction changes on average, when the variable value changes.",

MLCI feeds the orbital occupancy information (0 or 1) into hidden nodes, which produce one output, the probability of selecting that configuration. It shows great transferability across different geometries of the same molecule and an improvement over Monte Carlo configuration interaction (MCCI) . Restricted Boltzmann machine has also been used as a generative method to produce determinants . Chembot improves upon MLCI by replacing the occupancy vector with the density matrix diagonals and the configuration energy for featurization.",
  "Some limitations are also evident from these benchmarks that should encourage further work within the field. First, in the network exploration benchmarks ions and radicals were neglected from further exploration due to their distinct ERSs. Likewise, hypervalent elements showed distinct reactivity relationships that were only discovered via unintended channels. Benchmarking on these species and transition metals, which were also excluded here, are thus obvious extensions of this work. Second, the field would benefit from more diverse low-level models for estimating reactivity. GFN2-xTB, which was used here, is quite robust for screening reactions and estimating",
  "The geometry optimization of every oligomer was done in steps in order to reduce computational costs, starting with a conformer search and optimization using MMFF94 or UFF with OpenBabel version 3.1.0, 37 followed by GFN2-xTB, and ending with the B97-3c DFT functional 39 using Orca version 4.2.0. The single-point energy of each oligomer was calculated on the final optimized B97-3c geometry using the dispersion-corrected ωB97X-D3 DFT functional with the def2-SVP basis set 43 using Orca.

(iv) Formation of 12 is followed by rate determining insertion via a type of formal sigma complex assisted metathesis reaction (i.e. s-CAM) to afford one of several possible intermediates. One of these is a coordinated cis-stilbene in Z-13. Another possible outcome we considered is a geminal Haddition product gem-13, which is analogous to the transselective intermediates elucidated by Füstner and co-workers in certain Ru catalysts. While performing the DFT optimizations of 12, one of the computations initially gave product gem-13 Me . However, it is not a likely intermediate because it is unreasonably high in energy (See SI).",
  "Docking studies are performed with all these 81 existing drugs. Molecular docking is a technique used in structure-based drug design. In this technique, a preferred orientation is selected between two molecules to form a stable complex on the basis of scoring function . Vina vizard is used to complete the docking. Out of different orientations, orientation with the best binding affinity is chosen. Out of 81 available drugs, 27 are selected with the best scoring results.

  "To access short time scales of interface deformation, we exploit ultrasound-driven bubble oscillations. The periodic oscillations of the pressure around the ambient value, p 0 , caused by an acoustic wave, force the gas core of a bubble to undergo periodic compression and expansion at the same frequency.

The relation between these quantities is given by the Minnaert frequency, 30 modified to include surface-tension effects:",
  "The calculated vibrationally resolved absorption spectra for indole and tryptophan are quite similar both in terms of position of peak maximum and broadening. But for serotonin and melatonin, the peak maxima are shifted towards higher wavelength. This indicates that the effect of smaller substitution plays important role in the absorption wavelength showing a bathochromic shift which was already reflected in the order of HOMO-LUMO energy gap and vertical excitation energy.",
  "The theoretical ν5 spectrum shows very little activity below the vibrational origin, with the most intense peak in the region belonging to the 5 ! ( 6 ( ! transition, aligning with feature d5B. The discrepancy with experiment is again attributable to the absence of HT-allowed transitions in the theoretical model. The largest feature in the spectrum is the 5 ! ! sequence band, appearing a few hundred wavenumbers above the origin, corresponding to feature d5G in the experimental spectrum. Above that, matching with d5I, is the 5 ! ( 1 ( ! 6 ( ! transition. Unlike the theoretical H2CC¯ spectrum, only a single transition with significant 5 ! ! character appears in the D2CC¯ spectrum, indicating the neutral 5 1 state exhibits minimal anharmonic coupling with other vinylidene states.",

  "Assignment m/z error From the set of IMF assignments for expected EMFs in our example dataset, the patterns in mass error can be investigated. Both spectra were acquired using the same Thermo Tribrid Fusion instrument for which the stated mass accuracy is 1 ppm. The observed mass errors fall within this specification for 100% of the assigned IMFs for the validated EMFs. For the set of all assignments, validated plus unvalidated assignments and including all possible assignment for each peak, only 34 of 24215 fall outside the 1 ppm error specification. When only the best assignment for each peak is considered (lowest E-value), only 1 of 975 assignments have a ppm error over 1ppm. These results are consistent with previous findings that high mass accuracy alone cannot provide unambiguous metabolite formula assignments .",
  "The higher band (>1 kg/h) is representative of mid-to-small process upset conditions at upstream facilities. While the mean relative errors for solutions in this range are not as tight as expected from typical industrial instrumentation, these uncertainties represent reasonable estimates of larger emitters when observed over many estimates. As shown earlier, individual estimates, however, had wider condence interval. The lower condence limit for all solutions dropped below -80% of the emission rate, calling into question whether a large emitter would be quickly classied as `large' in eld conditions. The upper limit exceeded 240% of the emission rate; a large emitter estimated only a few times before mitigation could be substantially overestimated.",
  "In field deployments, the wide uncertainty limit on individual estimates for rates in this range can produce grossly misleading results for LDAR programs. • Performance from current study (2023): Figure shows that at 95% empirical confidence interval, 4 of 9 solutions had mean times to detection < 5 hours with upper limits < 15 hours; 2 solutions had upper limits less than the maximum release duration in this study (10.2 hours). Unlike the profile of emissions in this study (steady rates released for hours), several leaks typically found in the field are intermittent, hence solutions typically have shorter windows than available in this study to collect and communicate measurement data to operators. Additionally, results show that 6 of 9 solutions were operational at least 90% of their deployment time with 5 solutions operational throughout the study (operational factor of 1 -SI Table -2).

Viable synthetic routes for these candidates are identified through automated reaction pathway planning with ASKCOS (Autonomous Synthesis Knowledge Cloud Organized System). Ensembles of message-passing GNNs are employed for automated property prediction, evaluating candidates for specific optoelectronic properties like absorption, lipophilicity, and photostability. Robotic arms, batch reactors, and an automated liquid handler are integrated for automated synthesis to execute the recommended multi-step reaction pathways and isolate products.

Thus, this ROC AUC was used as µGTM fitness score. The best µ-maps here were selected from the list of five top-scoring GA chromosomes all with ROC AUC ≥ 0.89.",

  "Furthermore, isotherms based on FHH and Dubinin analyses can be initiated with thermodynamically rigorous kernel concepts but are often subsequently empirically modified by addition of an exponent in order to adequately fit isotherm data . Notably, the Ising model simplification of the unified isotherm requires no such empirical modification and uses a correct thermodynamic kernel in the form of modified Kelvin analysis to relate isotherm parameters to fluid properties, pore features and wetting energy. The coupling of Ising model with Modified Kelvin Analysis therefore offers utility of thermodynamic rigor together with isotherm fitting capability.",

  "A Keithley 4250 source-monitor unit (4-wire setup) was used to measure J-V curves under simulated solar radiation (100 mW/cm 2 irradiance) illuminated by a class-A++A+A LEDpowered solar simulator (SINUS-70 from Wavelabs). Calibration of the device to 1-sun intensity was performed using a Newport 91150-KG5 Reference Cell and Meter. J-V curves were obtained under ambient conditions. A quantum efficiency measurement device (QuantX-300, Newport) was used to collect EQE spectra. For the illumination during indoor J-V measurements, a WLED (Philips HUE) was used as a light source (color temperature: 4000 K). A PeakTech 5065 digital lux-meter was used to adjust the distance between the light source and solar cell to achieve 50-1000 lux illumination (refer to our previous article for further information about the indoor J-V measurements).

Structures were relaxed until maximum forces acting on each atom were below 0.02 eV Å -1 . A 4x4x2 and 2x2x2 k-points sampling mesh were used for CABI and CABI-Sb respectively; these values ensure converged energies within 3 meV/f.u. The light-tier1 basis of NAO was used for structural relaxations. The mixed occupancy of Bi/Ag/Sb/Vacancy was simulated via the special quasi-random structure (SQS) approach as implemented in the Alloy Theoretic Automated Toolkit code.

  "In summary, these new routes provide regioisomerically pure access to the biologically important selenenylsulfides TSA4 and TSA5, in short and streamlined synthetic sequences, and on multigram scale.

The time economy of both sequences allows rapid access to both thiaselenanes on scale in ~3 days, and ensures chemically pure supply of TrxR-selective probes such as RX1 for large-scale (high-throughput) cellular screening in cancer therapy and inflammation research. More broadly, the simplicity, efficiency and regioselectivity of the chalcogen introductions we perform, the densely functionalised protecting group chemistries in which we failed or succeeded, and the alternatives for selenenylsulfide formation methods that we present, may all empower future research: particularly in organoselenium chemistry, where constructing complex dichalcogenides and studying their structural features and exciting redox chemistry remains a wide-open topic.",

This is consistent with gas-phase MO theory, which says that the HOMO is endohedral π bonding. The first p z beaks below E F correspond to exohedral B-B σ bonds. We therefore believe that these borides are well described by the same bonding model as their gas-phase borane counterparts, so we can proceed to analyse them using the electron-counting rules described above.

We believe this is because a reactive monomeric form is accessible to 1, a notion that is supported through kinetic measurements (vide infra).",
  "Recent rules and regulatory policies, such as the US EPA final NSPS rules on alternative methane detection approaches 13 and the Inflation Reduction Act Waste Emission Charge 55 aimed at further reduction in methane emissions across the US O&G supply chain, have spurred increased attention to advanced emissions detection solutions. With standardized controlled testing identified as one of the steps involved in demonstrating emissions mitigation equivalence between these solutions and traditional LDAR approaches, this study, unlike prior works, represents a significant step forward in the controlled testing of nextgeneration survey solutions using a consensus test protocol. The study results have shown the following: First, while handheld OGI camera solutions had comparable or better performance than other categories of solutions across most performance metrics, no solution or category of solutions achieved all the desired performance levels across all metrics assessed. This implies that no category of solutions tested is superior as all solutions can systematically detect emissions successfully (atleast significantly better than random guessing as shown in SI section S-7.5), albeit with varying strengths and limitations hence the need for different value propositions for mobile solutions and handheld solutions.",

All good detector channels from each scan were then averaged together and the averages examined for evidence of metallic Fe contamination, which can significantly impact the data analysis at the low Fe concentrations present in the samples; if found the scan was discarded. The resulting scans were imported to the Demeter suite of programs 57 and individually assessed for homogeneity to one another. All good scans were averaged in Athena, normalized to an edge jump of 1.0, and a background spline removed using an Rbkg factor of 1.1.

  "Unfolding upon force necessarily occurs upon stretching the endto-end distance, whereas chemical or thermal unfolding involve different collective variables. In the experiments, unfolding intermediate are not routinely observed, especially at high forces, and the experimental signal typically records force unfolding as single events , with some exceptions . Yet, the time-resolution of the molecular simulations allows to unravel the microscopic details of these unfolding events, the presence of short-lived intermediates that cannot be observed in the experiments, and to understand the origins of mechanical resistance. These strategies are exemplified for four different systems that we recently investigated and that illustrate the interest in the molecular modeling of proteins under force, as now detailed.",

  "Several distinct patterns emerge by incorporating insights from the earlier surface chemistry and Li + /H + exchange characterization.

Second, all samples exposed to water (WT, WT:HT and LiOH:HT) have equal or greater average current densities for unstable overpotential growth compared Gb:Pol and HT LLZO. This may be linked to 3 which on all samples exposed water; however, confirm the effect of on wetting and interfacial stability.",

After chain assembly, and prior to cleavage from the solid support, the Fm group of FPD(OFm)AG-HMBA-CPG and the other two (E, K) peptides was removed by 20% piperidine/DMF (35min). HPLC-MS analysis showed 96% and 95% purities of for both Asp and Glu, and 86% for Lys (Table , entries 4-7).

  "In terms of butadiene productivity, 5Ag2Ta-SiO2 reaches 0.085 gBD gcat -1 h -1 at WHSV=1.12 h - 1 . This is lower than the record performance reached with other catalytic systems, such as Zn-Zr based zeolites. However, when comparing with other Ag/silica-based systems reported the literature, higher ethanol conversion and similar butadiene yields are obtained here with the best AASG-made catalyst. Also, it must be recalled that the AASG process is a straightforward one step, low waste preparation method that compares favorably to classical multistep catalyst preparation methods in the perspective of large scale production.",

  "It is so close to 4.12 K in Al-MOF that the two refined FF can generate almost the same simulated isotherms for MIL-68(In). The comparison was shown in supporting information. Metal ions in group IIIA (i.e., Al 3+ , In 3+ , Ga 3+ ) have +3 charges within MOFs, which makes their ion polarization effect with oxygen similar. Therefore, we obtain similar refined FFs from experimental isotherms of CAU-10(Al) and MIL-68(In).",
  "All all-atom configurations were first relaxed using the 6-step equilibration scheme recommended by CHARMM-GUI, followed by production runs of at least 200 ns. All MD simulations were performed using the NAMD (v3.0-GPU) simulation package with a 2 fs timestep. Langevin dynamics and the Nosé-Hoove Langevin Piston algorithm were used to maintain a constant temperature of 298 K and a normal pressure component P zz of 1 bar, respectively. As the method we chose for the 𝐾 ! calculation requires area per lipid results from several simulation of a bilayer under several different surface tensions, surface tensions were set to -7, 0, 7, and 15 mN/m for all systems.

The vertical dotted red lines highlight the constant kinetic energy of the CT feature. At the top of the maps, at the photon energies above 2474 eV, one can see contributions of the Auger lines corresponding to the excitation to high-energy delocalized states.

  "All calculations were performed using Density Functional Theory (DFT) within periodic boundary conditions through the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP). The rangeseparated, screened hybrid DFT exchange-correlation functional of Heyd, Scuseria and Ernzerhof with 25% exact Hartree-Fock exchange (HSE06) was used for geometry optimizations, calculations of optical dielectric constant, total energies and electronic band structures. To fully account for relativistic effects, spin-orbit interactions were included (HSE06+SOC) in all total energy, electronic and optical calculations. This level of theory is found to accurately reproduce the experimental electronic structure of Cs3Bi2Br9, an absolute necessity for accurate prediction of defect properties. Using the projector-augmented wave method, scalar-relativistic pseudopotentials were employed to describe the interaction between core and valence electrons. The optical dielectric response was calculated using the method of Furthmüller et al. to obtain the high-frequency real and imaginary dielectric functions.",
  "Collectively, results from the MD to QM-cluster model refinement point to the changing molecular positioning rather than model composition as the main source for changing reaction thermodynamics over the sampled times. We attempted to trace the thermodynamic differences to simple, easily quantifiable structural differences among the models, specifically by grouping models based upon RMSDs in backbone or side chain atoms. Ultimately, none of the metrics were better than random selection for acceptably sampling a statistical ensemble Figure : Mean activation free energy (brown), reaction free energy (magenta), and number of QM-cluster models with a given number of explicit water molecules (cyan) identified as having interatomic contacts with the chorismate for the 250 QM-cluster models built from selected MD frames.",

Both findings let to the hypothesis that an exchange of the SPO catalyst by (DAP)2 would enable a catalytic process without the visible light activation. Remarkably, 5 mol% (DAP)2 promoted a catalytic reaction in the absence of light forming 4a in 54 % yield. Further mechanistic experiments comprised initial-rate kinetic studies of the model reaction across a range of concentrations for each reaction component under visible light irradiation (see SI for details).

  "The workflow of SECSE is described in Fig. . In the first place, fragments/groups are docked/positioned into the pocket, from which the ones with high docking scores or ligand efficiency are picked as elites. It is noteworthy to point out that fragments with less than 13 heavy atoms are exhaustively enumerated as initial input, yet any given structures or functional groups can be used as starting points. Then all the elites are applied the rules to generate new molecules. The daughter molecules are clustered and sampled to represent the pool. The sampled molecules are docked into the pocket again. Highly scored molecules adopting hereditary or reasonable 3D orientation are chosen as new elites. This process concludes one cycle. After multiple cycles of iteration, a considerable number of compounds are generated and accumulated. To comprehensively evaluate all compounds, we introduced a graph-based machine learning module to speed up elite selection in each generation. Finally, hit compounds are visually inspected and selected before wet lab synthesis.",
  "SVS encompasses 404 distinct assays from 202 targets, enabling a statistically significant comparison among LBVS methods. The methods assessed included Spark (v10.4.0 from Cresset) in various configurations (default, protein structure-guided, and random low-energy conformations), RDKit Fingerprints , Smina (Apr 2016 build) , RDKit alignment (Align Min) with Smina scoring and Glide SP (Schrödinger Release 2017-2) . Since the case of discriminating MMPs is a classification task, ROC AUC was used as the primary metric. The SVS benchmark reveals a clear performance stratification, with Spark leading at ≈ 0.78 ROC AUC, followed closely by both CHEESE variants ≈ 0.75 (see Figure ). This superiority of shape-based and electrostatic comparison methods over docking with Glide or Smina is particularly notable given the benchmark's comprehensive scope of 404 assays across 202 targets. The substantial error bars across all methods indicate significant variability in performance.",
  "MMPA is applicable to both on-target SAR (e.g., biochemical activity measured against a single given protein) and ADME/Tox and PhysChem properties (e.g., logD, Kinetic Solubility). The 4/22 latter is especially well suited for MMPA because experimental data is abundant (at least in industry) from cross-project compound profiling, and because ADME properties can be more \"global\", meaning that additivity is more likely applicable-these properties are less likely to be dependent of the spatial orientation within a binding pocket. mmpdb requires three stages to obtain useful MMP analyses and predictions, as illustrated in Figure .",
  "Prediction of Cu 2+ binding sites. A systematic analysis of the previously reported protein structure (PDB: 1ytq) was made. A prediction of surface exposed residues was performed using both the primary sequence (NetSurfP-2.0 online server) and the crystalline structure (PyMol).

The activated sample (ca. 300 mg) was further degassed in situ for 1 hour before the measurements. Free spaces were determined at 0.7 bar Helium (He) and 25 °C. A background correction was performed by subtracting the adsorption of the empty sample cell from the obtained isotherms.",
  "To mimic Hammett tuning commonly employed in catalyst screening, we added functional groups to fragments and bridges of our macrocycles, thereby expanding our candidate space to nearly 16M compoundS. Because the most favorable macrocycles lack aromaticity, the improvement of reaction energetics achieved by changing the macrocycle or axial ligand exceeded what could be achieved through functionalization. Nevertheless, the majority of the final Pareto optimal set from this screen consisted of catalysts only identified after a full six generations of EGO. To refine our search, we downselected to a subset of favorable catalysts prior to functionalization. Over this set, we both improved model performance and observed that the best tradeoff between HAT and methanol release occurred when catalysts had negatively charged axial ligands that correlated to facile methanol release.",

  "The deviation between the observed and predicted structure of Fe 2 (Cl 2 dhbq) 3 prompted further consideration. A comparison of the energy between the computationally relaxed structure and constrained optimisation of the experimentally reported hexagonal phase revealed the latter to be more than 1 eV per atom higher in energy (Figure , x = 0). This anomalously large energy difference is due to a distinct electronic solution with spin localization on one ligand only, despite an initialization of spins on two different ligands (Figure ).",
  "To perform growing we replace only those hydrogen atoms which are at least at the distance of 2Å apart of any protein heavy atom. This will avoid growing in directions which do not have enough space to accommodate larger fragments. To control the number of generated compounds and make runtime more predictable one may specify the maximum number of randomly chosen replacements. If not specify, all possible replacements will be applied which can be very numerous for smaller context radiuses. We found that using 2000 random replacements works well and we used this number in all reported studies. Additionally, the size of steps in chemical space can be specified. By default, we attach fragments having up to 10 heavy atoms. Since CReM cannot create new cycle systems, it is required to choose this size large enough to enable rings addition to molecules.",
  "ToF analyzers typically incorporate an ion preparation and extraction device that have their own space charge related influences. For example, the common orthogonal extraction process, that pulls segments out of a continuous (or modulated/bunched) ion beam, may inject ions at very high repetition rates with usually high transmission losses , and leave little fear of exposing the analyzer to strong space charge effects -though these may still be notable . On the other side, extraction ion traps such as the C-Trap 18 may accumulate ions for a prolonged period, requiring several milliseconds for processing before pulse-extracting the entire ion set directly into the analyzer.",
  "The presence of both CO2 and humidity leads to smaller, but distinct, changes in Icage than in pure water vapor indicating that the micropores are permanently filled with the guests. Icage is lower than in the dry CO2 at 970 mbar (0% RH)-due to less Ps formation because of changes in the chemistry of inner cage surface when water exist, but it hardly changes with humidity up to ca. 70%. Above this pressure (at 10 3 mbar at 295 K in Fig. ) it still remains clearly above the humidified sample. This confirms our previous interpretation that water molecules are initially well dispersed in the cages filled with CO2 and only start to cluster at high humidity.",

The slow stirring rake provides improved uniformity in the suspension rheology and distribution of the fluidisation water, and in turn improved product discharge. Importantly, the rake zone provides the benefit of a dense medium effect, meaning the relatively coarse silicates are rejected from the final product. Those particles then concentrate in the zone above the rake.",

  "in the presence of benzyl alcohol led to product 11 although in a diminished yield (45%). It is noteworthy, when beneficial, a substrate ratio could be reversed and diazoalkane can be used in excess instead. Although experiments on O-H insertion revealed a negligible effect of moisture and air atmosphere on efficiency, dry and oxygen-free conditions were required for functionalizations of amines and thiols (for optimizations see SI). For reactions with both alkyl and aromatic amines, a slight decrease in yield was observed, in contrast with productive amine 15 formation (84%). N-hydroxy pyridine gave a mixture of O-H and N-H insertion products but, interestingly, upon isolation, a complete conversion to amide 18 occurred. The scope of tolerated thiols is also broad, even thiophenol and bulky adamantanethiol efficiently furnished products 20 and 21.",
  "The Frechét ChemNet distance (FCD) underlines the chemical distance between the reference and the generated distributions. As such, it is heavily in favour of the conditional models, because the seeds drawn from the test set purposely force the generated distributions towards it and consequently towards lower FCD values. Moreover, since the DRD2 train and test sets had been clustered, the fact that the transfer learning model was further trained on one of them explains the deviation from the other with respect to the FCD metric. Internal diversity exhibits also expected behaviour for a similar reason; the seeds narrow the output down compared to an ideally random sampler in the DRD2 active domain, such as the transfer learning model. Among all 25,600 molecule generations, higher novelty was achieved by the transfer learning model.",

It is therefore natural to ask whether TE performance actually benefits from band warping in TIs.",

  "To reduce strain in the ternary complex due to high energy conformations of the bound PROTAC linker, we elongated the linker in MZ1 from PEG3 to PPG3 to afford the design of HL1 (Figure ). The PPG3 chain was expected to reduce the strained gauche effects of -C-C-dihedrals in PEG3 linker, and this hypothesis was supported by MD-MSA simulation and MMPBSA scoring of HL1 linker-modified ternary complex after relaxation, which suggested a stronger induced PPIs contribution rather than PROTAC binding contribution to the overall stability of system (Figure ).",

  "Using polyhedral skeletal electron pair theory, we have rationalised all the boron anion networks formed by the MB 6 hexaborides at pressures up to 150 GPa. The applicability of this model was validated by band-decomposed charge density analysis, which revealed that the clusters in periodic are connected by B-B σ bonds, so they have the same structure-determining bonding interactions as gas-phase boranes. Increasing pressure causes clusters to coalesce, reducing the number of exohedral B-B bonds and causing moving the dominant cluster type from closo to nido. We therefore predict that under even higher The results may help to understand the exotic transport properties of hexaborides.",

The obtained results can be summarized as follows:",
  "The nonselective collision with H2 severely reduces the effective utilization of •OH for the target reaction, resulting in a limited photon utilization (0.0168 % for the reactor connected 4 chambers in series and 0.0469 % for the first chamber) that is far lower than 3.872 % obtained from the reaction in CO-rich ambient (CO: H2O = 1, Figure ). This issue related to low utilization of photoinduced",
  "The MD-MSA approach also captured the event of significant conformational transition (upper, The identification of such a conformational transition in solution demonstrates that our MD-MSA approach based on crystallography could provide additional insight compared to those widely reported (semi)rigid protein-protein docking workflows derived from Monte-Carlo approaches (e.g., MOE, RosettaDock, PRosettaC, FRODOCK and 'half-linker' FFT) for efficient search of ternary complex poses often starting from random poses with separate restraints by linker conformational space. In this new MD-derived cluster, the PEG3 linker adopted more extended conformations (Figure . a) rather than the collapsed state found by crystallography and conventional MD relaxations (Figure . b). These ternary poses also showed different protein-protein interfaces that might be more suitable for incorporating ARV771 with its shorter linker, which is also suggested by our recent biophysical and mutation studies showing that ARV771 should have native poses different from MZ1. To test this, we replaced MZ1 in the local minimum of ternary complex with ARV771 and ran five replicates of 200 ns simulation (SI Section_3). Most trajectories converged to structures which maintained the new contact between BRD4:BD2 and VHL, and all poses had very similar PROTAC conformations to each other (lower left, Figure . b).",
  "The reactor should be adjustable to a classical stirring plate (eg IKA plates or similar) without any adaptator. Reviewing recent literature we opted for the widely used Kessil ® PR160L LED lamps as our standard light source and Biotage ® 8 mL microwave tubes (outer diam = 17 mm, useful heigh = 77 mm) were chosen as reacting vials. -For reproducibility reasons, we wanted to design a reactor where several samples could be placed in such a way they receive identical optical power. -For efficiency reasons, we wished the samples to be as numerous as possible with the possibility to vary the distance to the lamp. The distance and height of the reacting tubes regarding the light source must be so that the optical power absorbed is maximized -At last, the system must be easy to fabricate in multiple copies and easy to set up with minimal user intervention.",
  "Appropriate chemical and geometric properties-including chemical composition and moieties, surface area and other pore structure features, topologies, and so forth-are made available to facilitate applications in HT screening and ML applications.

  "For MRCI wave functions, the comparatively small reference space R is associated primarily with a description of static correlation. In contrast, the FOIS F primarily captures dynamic correlation energy, and is in general large in size. Due to the size of the FOIS, the diagonalization of the electronic Hamiltonian projected onto the space spanned by the total CSF basis, R ∪ F , quickly becomes an extremely demanding computational task.",

  "Our synthetic approach (Scheme 1) began with a classic nucleophilic aromatic subsitution by reflux of p-nitroflourobenzene 1 in bisethanolamine 2. This reaction afforded diol 3 in 68% yield. The hydroxyl groups were activated by tosylation to afford 4 in a modest but useful 50% yield. Once purified, 4 was combined with 5, prepared by reported procedure, after it had been treated with K 2 CO 3 and refluxed in acetolnitrile to to carry out the double substitution, creating our desired bridged molecule 6 in 12% yield.",
  "In conclusion, a novel sulphur-embedded terrylene diimide with a wing-like structure having intense red emission has been successfully obtained using a simpler synthetic method high yields. The -expansion at the bay position helped to widen the bandgap and imparted structural rigidity, thus improving the radiative decay. The introduction of a donor-acceptor character between the heteroaromatic unit and TDI core further helped to reduce the ES1-T1, favouring a TADF emission with a quantum yield of 88%. The problem of aggregation in rylene diimides became a boon for this molecule, resulting in RTP. Therefore, it can be highlighted that TDI-cDBT shows excellent TADF emission under dilute conditions, whereas it demonstrates phosphorescence at higher concentrations. Hence, rigidification of the TDI core, along with heteroatom incorporation, can be an efficient strategy to achieve molecules with switching between red TADF and near-IR RTP.",
  "We have here shown its applicability to ADMET property comparison, which is of particular importance to drug development to ensure safety and efficacy of medications but notoriously difficult to predict given the complexity of the involved biological processes and the small datasets resulting from complex in vivo experiments.

We have chosen N 2 as a testbed system, that was also used in a corresponding commissioning work with a PEPIPICO endstation at the soft X-ray beamline FinEstBEAMS at the MAX-IV synchrotron . In the present case, the N 1s electrons were ionized by 4.9 keV photons, in HIKE regime. The electron energy resolution in the coincidence data is used here firstly to eliminate contributions from valence ionization and secondly, to filter out satellite transitions at lower kinetic energy than the main N 1s photoline. This does not require the highest possible electron resolution, which was set to ∼1 eV at 200 eV pass energy of the analyzer.",

  "In this letter, we investigate the nature of the RSL and its direct impact on the Li + kinetics. This study uses commercial SC NMC811 active material to make industry-relevant cathode coatings with characteristics and electrochemical performance comparable to commercial cells. With the same coatings, we manufactured full coin and pouch cell configurations to age and condition the SC-NMC cathode surfaces over 100 cycles, cycling in a full voltage range varying the UCV above and below the oxygen loss threshold, i.e. 4.2 -4.4 V. The ex-situ sXAS/DFT/DMFT/AIMD approach shows that the RSL is likely to be a LixNi1-xO with x = 0 to 0.125 system. Using the same cycling conditions, Operando XRD measurements on pilot-line-built A7 pouch cells were performed. By tracking the evolution of the (003)-reflection the effects of lithium trapped in RSL were directly observed, supporting our computational predictions on how these members of the RSL family can impair the Li + kinetics in Nirich layered cathodes. Details of pouch cells, electrodes, materials, and experimental methods are provided in the Supporting Information.",
  "Making the whole chamber, large or small, in just one cyclization is proposed for D227-C960 construction (Scheme 12) using Suzukicoupling and Diels-Alder benzyne condensation for gamma-togamma or alpha-to-alpha trimers 36, 41, connection, respectively, with the synthesis complexity at level 1. Dehydrogenation of the Diels-Alder product with DDQ is required for aromatization. Classification of the connection type between trimers in P-chambers extends to G-surface. Thus,  +  type seen in P197-C168 can be used for making related (via Bonnet rotation) G-Shwarzite G199-C336 by method 3 (Scheme 15), joining trimers 55 and 56 in 3:1 ratio into half-chamber 57 and pairing with the other similarly constructed half-chamber, 61. Synthetic design of the simplest representative, CLP93-C168 chamber (Scheme 16), proposes one cyclization between type 2 trimer beta carbons taking advantage of a higher reactivity of bromine vs. chlorine and B(OH)2 vs. BF3K in Suzuki-Miyaura coupling. Less reactive groups will be utilized for joining chambers together while the rest of the bonds can be accomplished by dehydrogenation. Dilution by hexagons (CLP131-C216, Scheme S5) requires a larger set of building blocks and higher complexity. Synthesis of IWP204-C576 chamber might be possible from a single monomer 68 using different reactivity groups in stages. Less reactive Cl and BF3K will be used for the final stage connecting cube corners into periodic structure (Scheme 17).",
  "The PBEsol exchange-correlation functional was used for force calculations, as it has shown to give a good description of lattice dynamics. The cutoff of 520 eV used for structural relaxation was also used for the force calculations to ensure accurate forces. SOC effects were not taken into account as they often have a negligible impact on phonon frequencies but greatly increase the computational cost. The k-point meshes used for the primitive cells were scaled appropriately for the supercell calculations. The κ l of both structures were computed using Γ-centred q-point meshes with 15×15×15 subdivisions (Figure ), using the linear tetrahedron method for the BZ integration. 3 Results and Discussion",
  "The criterion for identifying erroneous structures in MOFChecker is whether they can achieve a reasonably optimized structure using DFT. This criterion is chosen to avoid potential structural distortions within reasonable limits, such as relatively too long or short bond length and distorted angle from the standard hybridization model. These structures can be fixed through DFT optimization, so it would be unfair to classify them as errors arbitrarily.",
  "Lastly, we anticipated that chirality at sulfur could transfer to new carbon stereocenters in the arylethylamine products in accord with literature precedent. To evaluate the asymmetric variant of this methodology, (S)-(+)-1f was synthesized and employed in the aminoarylation of 4-bromo-1-butene. The enantioenriched product 2q was then cyclized to afford (S)-(-)-3q in 86:14 er as determined by chiral supercritical fluid chromatography (Scheme 4B). Absolute configuration was assigned retroactively by derivatization of 3q to a known compound and comparison of its specific rotation to the literature value. This encouraging result is the starting point for further refinement and understanding of the factors dictating enantioselectivity in this transformation.",
  "In the notable CASCADE study, The first example of adopting true transfer learning for predicting chemical shifts was done in a recent work by El Samman et al. The authors extracted atomic embeddings from the last interaction layer from the SchNet model trained to predict molecular energies on the QM9 dataset. The authors tested linear and feedforward network models for different chemical tasks, including predicting carbon chemical shifts calculated by HOSE codes. However, the dataset for the chemical shifts consisted of only 200 examples of shifts predicted by the HOSE code, so the performance relative to the literature models trained from scratch could not be assessed.",
  "Remarkably, the selective hydroxylation of tert-butyl groups emerges as more than an atomic transformation from C-H to C-O, offering an innovative approach for molecular disconnection.

It was then solvated in a cubic box using preequilibrated water molecules (TIP3P) and neutralized by replacing bulk water molecules with Na + neutralizing ions. The :inal system was then minimized in the presence of periodic boundary condition, PME, non-bonded cutoff of 16 Ad along with truncation (VFSwitch) of van der Waals between 10-12 Ad using 200 steps SD and 1000 steps ABNR.",

  "The crystallographic orientation-dependent corrosion of Cu has been studied, again utilizing dodecane oil, to achieve a triple-phase environment. Chronopotentiometry measurements were performed (Figure ) under O2 or Ar atmosphere, to highlight key electrochemical processes underpinning localized Cu corrosion across a wide range of surface structural facets and grain boundaries identified by co-located EBSD. In a follow-up study employing voltammetric mode SECCM, the efficiency of an oil soluble derivative of the classic Cu corrosion inhibitor benzotriazole was quantified for both anodic (copper dissolution) and cathodic processes, presented against structural variations of the surface. Another model system explored by a similar approach was the dissolution of Ag 261 and its local reaction kinetics. Voltammetric mapping and additional co-located AFM characterization allowed extensive analysis of the dissolution mechanism and the prominent role of surface grain boundaries.",

  "The crystal structure of AmpC Ent385 in complex with ceftazidime (AC state) was taken from the crystal structure, Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 6LC9. The coordinates for AmpC P99 were taken from PDB code 4XUX (complex with a covalent boronic acid inhibitor, RPX-7009), and ceftazidime was modeled in through alignment with 6LC9 (no clashes with protein residues occur). The parameters used for the ceftazidime adduct with Ser64 were the same as those described previously. The AmpC Ent385 PDB file was used as the starting structure for constant pH MD (CpHMD) simulations, in Generalized Born implicit solvent (using the GB OBC model, igb=2 in Amber20). In this simulation, we titrated the important catalytic residues Lys67, Tyr150 and Lys315. Their protonation and deprotonation events were evaluated during simulations at a pH of 7.2.",
  "The preceding sections emphasize the structural, mechanical, optical, and conductivity property differences observed in a dimorphic aromatic system having distinct molecular arrangements. The metastable block-shaped BZB form is an example of a disappearing polymorph; as with the appearance of BZN, we could not generate the former crystal form even after repeated attempts and varying conditions. The BZB with a stacked columnar arrangement Characterization: Single crystal diffraction data were taken using a Rigaku Saturn 724+ HG diffractometer with monochromated Mo Kα radiation and processed using the Rigaku Crystal Clear software. The structure was solved using direct techniques, and the refinements were done using full-matrix least-squares on F 2 using the SHELXTL suite of programs and OLEX2.

Crystallization commenced only after removal of P-ser from the crystallization solution, but the terrace steps are misaligned with the underlying crystal substrate. This implies that within the experiment timeframe (hours), stabilization of the ACC deposition took place and crystal overgrowth happened on a permanent defect, that consists of P-ser stabilized ACC.",
  "Two different ionization states of ASP26 (neutral: ASH, and negatively charged: ASP) on human thioredoxin conformer (PDB ID: 3TRX) are considered. Topology and coordinate files are built with the default ionization states for residues in ff14SB force field for proteins 129 using tleap module of AmberTools21 128 . The samples are neutralized using Na+ counter ions; 4Na + for the sample containing neutral ASP, and 5 Na + for the sample containing negatively charged ASP. To provide salt concentration, 5 Na + and 5 Cl -counter ions are added to the samples. Waters in the original crystal structure are deleted, and the samples are solvated using TIP3P water molecules with a distance between solute and the edge of the box as 12Å, which results in an average box dimension of 66.8 Å x 69.7 Å x 62.3 Å.",

The energy surfaces and structure types for each structure are shown in Figure -b. Unlike the Ribosome case, which searches for assembly pathways, the point of transit was set to 0 as in the case of chignolin, because the protein conformational changes are comprehensively searched for.

  "Our research shows that the stability of polyesters during SEC-MS analysis is strongly influenced by the choice of alkali metal salt used during ioniza on. For example, using LiI or NaI for PLA alipha c polyesters can lead to fragmenta ons during ESI-MS, while using CsI can prevent this issue. Similar results are also observed for PLGA, where cesium carboxylated is mainly observed when characterizing acid-terminated polymers, simplifying the polymer MS assignment, and removing instances in which isomeric PLGA structures cannot be dis nguished. This method allows for endgroup and chemical composi on determina on.

  "We use the unrestricted formalism (UKS or unrestricted Kohn-Sham) of DFT, which is more suitable for the treatment of systems with unpaired electrons, as bonds could be broken and reformed. It is even more so relevant as the literature on this class of reactions mentions diradical intermediates, as we also indicate in Scheme 1, However, the broken-symmetry approach for DFT is in common use with organic singlet di-radicals, and despite its limitations still provides a black-box approach to treat molecules with a small to intermediate diradical character, which would otherwise need to be modeled with multireference methods.

  "Crystallographic studies: Needle shape single crystals were selected from the product in an argon filled glove-box and mounted in a glass capillary which was subsequently sealed to prevent contact with air, and checked for singularity. The best one was used for full data collection on the Enraf-Nonius CCD (Mo-Kα radiation, Graphite monochromator) at room temperature with a crystal-detector distance of 40 mm, yielding reflection over the range 4.08° <  < 25.35°. The data were processed using the SHELXTL package. The structures were successfully solved by direct method (SHELXS97) 21b and the refinements (on F 2 ) were performed through the programs and SHELXL97. The unit cell parameters were determined and refined using all the reflections from the 473 collected images. Systematically absent reflections were consistent with the triclinic unit cell, space group P 1 . Bi and Sn positions were assigned on the basis of peak height and atomic distances. Most of the Na positions were found in the difference Fourier map. The two bounded Sn1 shows relatively small ADPs with some residual electron density indicating possible Sn-Bi mixed occupancy. Despite residual electron density at one Sn1 position, the refinement of the Sn/Bi mixed occupancy at Sn1 position was instable. Partial defects were also tested for all Na positions, giving no significantly lower occupation factors which may be possible at only two positions (Na2 and Na3) with less than 5% defect in total, suggesting a possible correlation with suspected the Bi/Sn1 mixed occupied position. The final refinement was done assuming neither Na defect and nor partial mixing at two bonded Sn positions. The final refined composition was Na13Sn26Bi and the corresponding residuals were R1 = 0.0422 and wR2 = 0.0818for all data. The crystallographic data as well as the structure refinement data are summarised in Table and the atomic positions and equivalent isotropic displacement parameters are listed in Table . The only faint indications of eventual crystallographic errors might be the strong asymmetry of the anisotropic thermal ellipsoid observed for Na1 and Bi1. As described below, these atoms have quite unusual coordination environment and are located on the special positions at the inversion centres. The single crystals are additionally plagued with pseudo merohedral twinning, emulating the monoclinic C2/m symmetry, with am = 2c, bm = a, cm = a/2 and  = 100.59(1)°. The relatively strong peaks and holes in the residual Fourier map are the result of these twinning issues with often completely overlap diffraction spots from the different crystal domains.

  "The side chain substituents at position 2 (see scheme) in alloxydym derivatives show great influence in the herbicidal activity and so in its toxicity. Substituents other than n-Pr, i.e. H and Ph, brought about no or very low effectiveness. These results are comparable to the rotational energy barrier for benzidine (0 to 2.61 kcal/mol). This rotational freedom allows benzidine and their selected derivatives to freely interact with various components in real life systems and is thus the possible reason for their toxicity.",

In our device stack the EQEmax is limited to ~11% for this emitter compared to ~25% for DMAC-TRZ, both at 10 wt% concentration in mCBPCN host and largely a result of ACRSA's low PLQY and slow radiative decay rate (with slow PF).",

  "Something that could be considered counterintuitive is that even if the reaction were proceeding from the much deeper potential energy well of INT 3 , the result is nearly identical once the reaction is heated. Only around room temperature do we see lower predicted selectivity, along with a temperature-independent plateau. This plateau of the product ratio is caused by the decreasing impact of the tunneling contribution, which strongly favors the Z product. With an imaginary mode at -1402 cm -1 , TS Z has a narrower and higher barrier, as opposed to -876 cm -1 for TS E . Product selectivity peaks when the temperature is high enough that the pure TST rate dominates and then decreases.",

  "Flat molecules are frequently observed in supramolecular polymerizations due to ease of access to these structures synthetically . Bowl shapes , and more so saddles , are far less commonly used topographies for the opposite reason. Yet, to introduce order in an assembly, negatively curved systems stand out as preferred candidates to induce eclipsed stacking because transverse rigidity is increased on both molecular and macroscopic scales . Asymmetry in saddle design, in addition to replacing a uniform surface with a framework scaffold, heightens the entropic barriers further due to unequal axes of principal curvature (Fig. ). An energetic minimum can then be reached with eclipsing negatively curved frames such that small deviations from overlap demand a high energetic penalty and, consequently, enforce order. Depending on the asymmetry of the saddle, their assemblies likely present intrinsically differentiated lateral interactions permitting the formation of tertiary structures. Müllen and co-workers first reported a small saddle-shaped molecule that possesses these characteristics within the aryl frame. Remanufacturing of this core with different functional groups could serve as a monomer suitable for such polymerization (Fig. ).",

When combined with an effective strategy to monitor the progress of the free energy estimate and its error, OneOPES produces accurate and reliable free energy results in less than 700 ns of sampling per replica in most cases.

  "The created database was used to train an initial ensemble of six NNPs, enabling active learning to further extend the database with configurations of sparsely interpolated or yet unseen parts of the PES. This is achieved by monitoring the deviation of the six energy predictions from the average ensemble prediction which acts as estimator of the prediction accuracy during NNP simulations. We performed 70 NNP level MD runs (1 ns at 1000 K and 2000 K) for Ptn (n = 1-5) in TON, MOR, MWW, LTA, CHA, MFI, and FAU (primitive unit cell). These MD runs sampled large parts of the PES of Pt in industrially relevant zeolites, including highly energetic reactive events. To also cover lower energy parts of the PES, local optimizations were applied to 1000 structures extracted from each MD trajectory.

  "The smallest QM-cluster models built with probe, arpeggio and F-SAPT schemes showed critical differences in how the kinetic and thermodynamics were altered by subsequent addition of residues. Once model building schemes approach the size of the \"maximal\" model, all three iterative schemes behaved similarly. We have seen some methodological issues with the arpeggio ranking scheme where ties can occur in the number of contact counts or contact types. The tie issue in arpeggio was resolved manually, and fixed an outlying reaction free energy that was observed in one of the smaller QM-cluster models. The solution to tie interaction counts or types will require more automation to be incorporated into RINRUS functionality.",

  "The base electronegativities χ 0 i , as well as k χ CN ,i and k χ q ,i , are element-wise empirical parameters that provide the necessary flexibility of the geometry-dependent effective χ. Finally, we modify the distance dependence of the bond capacitance in the Maxwell capacitance matrix. Poier and Jensen use the exponentially decaying overlap of the Gaussian charges in BC, similar to the QTPIE model by Chen and Martinez. However, such a rapid decay of the bond capacitance often suppresses genuine CT in zwitterionic species. To allow genuine CT to the extent possible, we employ an error function-based decay of the bond capacitance beyond a cutoff radius. The latter is determined by the pairwise van der Waals radii R vdW introduced in the DFT-D3 dispersion correction:",

  "Option B could present a path to continuous implementation, but dosing of UHP must be solved. Continuous addition of UHP as a solid seems reasonable on first inspection; however, vapor of the highly volatile TFAA (bp: 40 °C) could come in contact with the UHP solids stored in a charging vessel above the reactor. This could cause a serious incident since TFAA and peroxide quickly and exothermically react to form TFPAA.",

  "While the qMSM has already demonstrated the ability to significantly reduce the amount of MD data required to predict the long-time conformational dynamics of systems ranging from alanine dipeptide and the FiP35 WW domain, to the human argonaute complex and RNA polymerase, construction of the memory kernel can be challenging, its truncation can be susceptible to statistical noise associated with limited simulation data, and its interpretation eludes the simple states-and-rates framework that renders MSMs conceptually transparent and straightforward. Below we introduce two recently developed methods to address these problems which demonstrate great potential in leveraging memory to capture the long-timescale biomolecular dynamics.",
  "A similar approach of exploiting morphological data to inform simulations was adopted to reassess the interfaces shown in Figure heteroepitaxy. We focus on thin films because colloidal heterostructures are not as common for oxides, which limits the availability of high quality atomic-resolution images. For all the examples presented in Figure we adopt the epitaxial orientation reported in the original publication, for which Ogre indeed finds low strain and small supercell area (see 2D-supercells in Figures ). Subsequently, the interface models produced by the surface matching and ranking procedure (see Tables ) were compared to the experimental TEM images. All models were scaled isotropically without adjusting the epitaxial registry and interfacial distance.",
  "The composite formed by PAni and Pb 2+ ions shown in this work proves to be an interesting material for lead-acid batteries' negative plates. The composite presents a high onset potential for hydrogen evolution (up to -0.75 V vs Ag/AgCl). In this work, it was tested to prevent hydrogen evolution from a carbon fiber intended to become a current collector, but maybe its use can be expanded as part of the negative active mass (NAM).",
  "Since the PI and PI+ models enforce unity in composition and abundance through the softmax activation function, L unity and L weight remain zero for these models, whereas the baseline model violates these constraints (Figure ). The PI+ model, trained with additional constraints, demonstrates smaller deviations in chemical equilibrium potential (∆µ) and marginally improves composition prediction, split loss, and free energy minimization loss compared to the PI model. Overall, designing a physics-informed model architecture to enforce material constraints is essential; however, the addition of extra losses or masks complicates training without yielding significant improvements in phase classification or equilibrium composition prediction. Therefore, the PI architecture, without additional losses, emerges as the best practical choice for implementation. Post-ML optimization error analysis was performed on a random sample of 187 twophase and 76 three-phase equilibrium phase diagrams, using models trained on fold 1 data (Tables and). The results indicate that Newton-CG optimization, initialized with predictions from ML models, achieves near-perfect success rates and significantly reduces deviations from true equilibrium compositions compared to individual ML model predictions.",

Thermopower experiments to determine the sign of the Seebeck coefficient S or investigating junctions fabricated with a given molecule and electrodes having different work functions Φ. may settle this issue; positive (negative) S means negative (positive) ε 0 , 81 higher (lower) current for larger Φ means negative (positive ) ε 0 ;",

Indeed, under heterogenous conditions and slow diffusion of iPr2Zn vapour, excess aldehyde is retained throughout the process which allows trapping of Zn-alkoxide in the form of acetal equilibrium mechanism.

  "Accessing the two polarization states to dynamically create distinct chemical surfaces would enable regulated adsorption and desorption at the photoanode surface while simultaneously maintaining strong photocurrent generationa particular capability unique to ferroelectric surfaces, which in principle can help overcome the Sabatier principle. From a fundamental perspective, direct evidence of ferroelectric switching on the electronic properties and surface chemical states of a BFO/BVO photoanode remains elusive. Other reports typically provide photocurrent performance without detailed physico-chemical characterization of the poled states.

  "After isolating complexes that contain two dithiolene ligands and at least one terminal chalcogen as the most representative mimics of FDHs, 88 complexes remain. Next, we mutated any terminal chalcogen sites in this set with O, S and Se. Prior to this step, only 7 complexes contained sulfido and only 4 selenido ligands, with the majority of compounds containing terminal oxo moieties. After performing the mutations, we obtained a dataset of 348 complexes that has increased balance between different terminal chalcogens in comparison to the original CSD-derived set (Supporting Information Table ). On this set, we use the molSimplifycomputed molecular graph determinant to perform a connectivity uniqueness check after the chalcogen mutation to avoid repeat simulations. We remove 93 duplicates through this check, producing 255 complexes with unique connectivity, which increases to 276 if also considering CSD-assigned metal oxidation states (Supporting Information Tables ).

  "It is quite plausible that space charge effects might be stronger for lower m/z ions, depending on their m/z dependent RF trapping conditions during the experiment. More likely however is that the instrument tuning was itself m/z dependent, for example the ion energy on extraction from the R-trap can be expected to vary substantially due to the slow rise time of the pulsed extraction potential, which may possibly then result in excess clipping of the beam within the analyzer and apparently enhanced resolution for the surviving ions. Either way, substantial space charge related loss of resolution is indicated to appear with hundreds of ions detected in peak per shot. Optimally this would itself be tuned, so that perhaps severe loss occurred at higher levels.",

  "In conclusion this method serves as an encouragement to combine the current power of computer and data science, but eliminate the black box behavior of many algorithms by grounding the approaches in chemically accurate models. When physical effects are present their ability to give context to bare data science should not be disregarded, if not for improved performance, then for understanding of the models. Our developed method could initially be validated on increasingly complex real data. If the method proves to give accurate insights it could serve as a new standard in utilization of kinetic datasets, and reduce speculation in finding the real chemistry driving them. With the advent of automated chemical machines, Chemfit and optimizations using it might be appropriate fits for autonomous reaction testing, mapping and optimization.

The initial work solely computed reaction thermodynamics obtained from gas phase electronic energies, neglecting vibrational and other entropic or enthalpic corrections, solvent effects, and omitting calculation of transition states, which are all conventions that we extend to the present study on the data set from prior work. The exchange-resampling procedure follows the one we established previously in which we vary the HF exchange fractions (a HF ) from 0.00 to 0.30 in increments of 0.05 while holding the LDA/GGA exchange ratio fixed and reoptimize the gas phase structure. As with the original calculations , the exchange-resampling geometry optimizations were automated with mAD [106] in 24-hour increments with resubmissions for up to five additional runs. At each exchange fraction, the structure is reoptimized starting from the geometry and converged wavefunction of the prior exchange fraction. If one a HF optimization did not converge, calculations with the subsequent a HF value(s)",
  "Crambin. The initial structure was obtained from PDB ID: 2FD7 , with mutated residues reverted to the wild-type sequence. The system was solvated with 8205 explicit water molecules. Simulations were performed for 1 ns at 300 K, excluding the first 500 ps for equilibration. The root mean square deviation of Crambin, RMSD(t, t+∆t), was obtained excluding hydrogen atoms from three 3 ns runs. Power spectra were computed from atomic velocities sampled over a 125 ps trajectory with a time resolution of 2.5 fs using schnetpack package .",
  "Besides the accuracy of the method, an important factor for conformational sampling is its computational cost. For a representative number of methods, we show the computation time to evaluate the whole ACONFL benchmark set, together with their MAE. The wall times were obtained by parallel calculations using four CPU cores and are shown in Fig. . The evaluation of single point energies is representative for a reranking of an ensemble generated by a lower level method in a multilevel workflow, however less suitable for semiempirical methods as those are usually used in the generation of the ensemble in geometry optimizations as additional overhead from the restart or program invocation can be already substantial compared to the total runtime.",
  "The results display that LSCO is not suited for use in AEL as it would decompose during off periods when the potential approaches the oxygen equilibrium potential. During AEL operation, the materials will also experience high anodic potentials, which may further challenge their stability beyond what was assessed by the accelerated immersion test. The catalysts that showed good stability at the accelerated immersion test were, therefore, further tested electrochemically at industrial OER conditions.",
  "Free energy analysis of diffusion: The free energy pathway for iodide diffusion was considered by first identifying an initial location A on the lattice and a second vacant position B, which was constructed by removing an iodine from a previously generated reference configuration. After A and B were defined, steered molecular dynamics (SMD) was used to identify an initial pathway for umbrella sampling .",

  "Nevertheless, we should point out that a supported phospholipid bilayer system is very sensitive to temperature, ionic strength and contamination (for example lipid and IL residues on the AFM tip), especially during the mechanical investigation. Rotella et al. performed indentation experiments on supported POPC bilayers interacting with 0.5M [C4MIM][Cl] in deionized milliQ water (instead of physiological buffer like in our experiments), measuring a slight increase of thickness (0.5 nm) and slight increase of all mechanical parameters.",

  "In Figure , it is illustrated, in a similar case to NaCt (section 3.2), that decreasing the amount of ethanol while the amount of HQ increases (to balance the total amount of species playing the source of reducing agents) does not lead to any benefits compared to performing the surfactant-free synthesis. The latter surfactant-free approach still leads to the colloidal dispersions with the lower λspr values and narrower spr peak.",
  "Ultimately, the key factor in providing an efficient Suzuki coupling between 45 and 33a proved to be the inclusion of a stoichiometric copper(I) additive as initially described by chemists at Merck. In agreement with these authors, we also found stoichiometric CuCl to be superior in this regard and after minor adjustments to other parameters (entries 5-11) including increasing the equivalents of boronate partner 33a, base, and CuCl, we were able to reproducibly generate coupled product 46 in 44% NMR yield (entry 9). On preparative scale we were able to obtain triaryl 46 in an improved 54% isolated yield under analogous conditions. Unfortunately, attempted deprotection/spirocyclization of monoester 46 under the prior BF3-mediated conditions resulted in rapid decomposition even at lower temperatures. Thus, milder Lewis acidic conditions were required to effect this key C-C bond forming event in the monoester series; in the end, the use of Ce(OTf)3 in a combination of HFIP and DCE at 85 °C was identified as optimal, providing spirocycle 47 in moderate yield (47%). Pleasingly, application of the prior oxindole reduction conditions delivered spiroindimicin B (2) in 58% yield, completing a 6-step total synthesis (5.6% overall yield).",

  "GO on plain water shows a bimodal peak at maximum intensity with centers at approximately 3200 and 3400 cm -1 , assigned to strongly and weakly hydrogen bonded -OH stretches of interfacial water, respectively. The absence of signal near 3700 cm -1 suggests there are no water molecules with free-dangling -OH bonds pointing upward away from the subphase, meaning a uniform film is present. XPS results show primarily carbon and oxygen signal with some sulfur contamination (Supporting Information) and a 5.21 carbon : oxygen ratio, meaning our GO films are primarily carbon and lack a significant amount of oxygen functional groups. Accordingly, our SFG data agree with other published experimental SFG data on a thermally reduced GO film spincoated on sapphire. Our GO films are self-assembled at the interface without a solid substrate and can provide adsorption information relevant to soft-scaffold separation systems.",
  "To tie down the source of the transferred H-atom in the formation of unlabelled xylene in experiments in C6D6, we considered preparing deuterated iodoxylene, 7-d6 (i.e. labelled in the methyl groups) and using it in place of 7 in this experiment. However, it was more convenient to prepare iodomesitylene-d9, 17 (Scheme 4) as shown in S.I. To detect the formation of the Ar-D bond in a mesitylene product, From this experiment, GCMS also detected a trace of phenanthroline. This showed an envelope of peaks 180-187, with 184 as the base peak. For undeuterated phenanthroline, m/z = 180, so peaks at masses 181-187 show that phenanthrolinyl radicals were repeatedly formed in the reaction by H-atom abstraction, and that these radicals then abstracted a D atom from 17 or a derived product, or from C6D6.",
  "Ca/Si ratios were determined using ICP-AES (Varian 720ES Agilent).

  "We first tested thermal decomposition as a standard procedure towards the preparation of monodisperse Fe3O4 NP. Ligand exchange afterwards yielded pAA-AAP functionalized MNP (Supporting Information, Figure ). Throughout our experiments, good dispersibility in THF was achieved, but all attempts towards investigation of these NP in water failed due to rapid aggregation. A possible reason for this could be an incomplete ligand exchange of oleic acid and oleylamine acting as stabilizing ligands during thermal decomposition.",
  "According to the BOLS-NEP notion, the atomic 1-2 bond contraction densifies the local electrons and deepens the potential well that entraps the core and bonding electrons. The locally and densely entrapped electrons polarize the valence electrons of the even undercoordinated atoms. Based on this principle, we further examined the valence ∆LDOS shifts, as shown in Fig. and. The LDOS transition from the bulk to the adatom is obtained by subtracting the LDOS of the bulk standard from the one with an X after the LDOS is area normalized. An LDOS peak integral is proportional to the charge of the adatom ∆q (in fraction) transferring from the bulk reference of the catalyst (spectral valley).",
  "The ChEMBL database was searched for human ALR2 inhibitors with activity data (IC50) from the same research group. Cmp126 (pIC50 5.21) was chosen as the hit in our hit-to-lead optimization workflow.

Cmp126 was aligned to the co-crystallized Zopolrestat based on substructure alignment within Flare. The aligned compound (cmp126) was then used as the starter molecule for R-group replacement using Cresset Spark 2 . The prepared protein with all crystallographic waters removed was imported into Spark with the input protonation retained and used as an excluded volume to guide the search. The phenyl benzoxazole in the starter molecule was selected as the region to replace (Figure",
  "The NEB calculations have been carried out with seven distinct images for the binary compounds, and four distinct images for the ternary spinels to evaluate the Mg-ion migration minimum energy path. Note that the diffusion in the considered compounds corresponds to interstitial diffusion. The calcalutions for the ternary compounds were carried out in a charge-neutral fashion whereas for the binaries a compensating background charge was applied in the NEB calculations as in these materials typically the overall charge neutrality is ensured by an equal amount of anion and cation vacancies.",
  "The 2D-optimization of the pulse sequence started with 4aminopyridine and it involved independent measurements varying N irradiation frequencies and amplitudes (Fig. ). Based on independent 180 measurements (conducted in ∼ 140 min), optimal polarization transfer regions were identified: one at the frequency of the 15 N SLIC pulse of 214.5 ppm and B1 amplitude of 8 Hz, and another at the frequency of 219 ppm and 8 Hz. As expected, these regions exhibited opposite signs of the signal enhancement .",
  "We equilibrated each protein-ligand complex obtained from docking with 7 ns of MD in explicit solvent in order to obtain more physically realistic starting poses for MD TI simulations and to eliminate ligands with unstable binding poses from further consideration (see Methods for details). To identify ligands with significant instabilities observed during equilibrium MD simulations, we computed the mean RMSD of a ligand with respect to the average structure of the ligand extracted from the final 5 ns portion of production MD simulations, RMSDavg. We then excluded all ligand with the mean RMSDavg > 3 Å from further evaluation (11 molecules in total); thus, 793 molecules advanced to ABFE simulations by MD TI.",

  "The SMILES strings created with the generative models were converted into 3D geometries using the distance geometry approach implemented in RDKit, 57 followed by refinement of atomic positions with the MMFF94 force field. These initial geometries were optimized at the GFN2-xTB 60,61 level, providing an initial 3D geometry for subsequent gas phase density functional theory (DFT) geometry optimization at the ωB97X-D 62 / 6-31G(d) level. Using the same functional and basis set, TD-DFT computations with Tamm-Dancoff approximation were carried out to determine vertical excitation energies and to perform excited-state geometry optimizations to extract adiabatic excited-state energy values. The diradicaloid character was assessed by computing open-shell singlet wavefunctions at the UHF/6-31G(d) level on the DFT optimized geometries and extracting the diradical character (y 0 ) and the tetraradical character (y 1 ) diagnostics as introduced by Nakano and coworkers. All electronic structure computations were performed using the Gaussian16 70 (revision A.03) software package.",
  "The set of commercially available BBs from eMolecules Inc . and Enamine used for DEL enumeration in our previous study was taken as input to the CoLiNN model. BBs were standardized using ChemAxon Standardizer according to the procedure implemented on the Virtual Screening Web Server of the Laboratory of Chemoinformatics at the University of Strasbourg. This process includes dearomatization and final aromatization (heterocycles like pyridone are not aromatized), dealkalization, conversion to canonical SMILES, removal of salts and mixtures, neutralization of all species, except nitrogen(IV), generation of the major tautomer according to ChemAxon. After standardization and duplicate removal 70 691 unique BBs were obtained. For each of them, a unique identifier starting from 0 was given. For training of the global CoLiNN model, only 388 DELs with unique reaction schemes were used that employ 64 869 BBs for their enumeration from the total BB set.",
  "As an application, starting from experimental current-voltage data measured for a real molecular junction, we will illustrate (Section 7) how a (Sommerfeld-Arrhenius ) transition from a current weakly varying with temperature at low T to a strongly temperature current at high T can be be controlled by tuning the applied bias voltage within a \"tunneling-throughout\" scenario.",
  "However, when a 1:1 ratio of HFIP:DCM was used, an increase in the reaction yield to 77% yield via NMR conversion was observed (entry 6). For all these tests, 1 equivalent of nBu4NBF4 was used. Other tests were performed, varying conditions, but unfortunately no better results were obtained, being the reactional condition of entry 6 the best result obtained in batch electrochemistry. Similar results to batch electrochemistry were obtained using home-made flow electrochemical reactor (Table , Figure ). However, working under safer conditions and continous product formation using reactor is advantigous as compared to batch electrochemistry. The flow electrochemical reaction was aslo performed with different substrate 6, aiming to apply this methodology for amination to obtain annulation product 7 (scheme 4).",
  "To evaluate the different disconnection-aware strategies, we analyzed targets from PaRoutes set-n1 and Reaxys-JMC synthetic route datasets. Bond constraints were extracted from the synthetic routes using a convergent disconnection score (see the Methods section for details). The template-based model returned the 50 highest ranked predictions. Because the disconnection matching accuracy saturated at top-5 (Figure ), Chemformer used a beam size of five in the search. Figure shows the performance of the four breaking bond strategies and standard search on the PaRoutes set-n1 dataset. Figure shows the corresponding results for Reaxys-JMC targets.",
  "The scores matrix 𝑆 is a rotation of X by the vector W. By definition, these rotation axes are chosen to maximize the variance captured within each axis. The reasoning behind this approach is that PCA transformation makes underlying spatial features in MSI images more apparent by emphasizing the dominant trends, hence facilitating Noise2Void denoising that now operates on a cleaner signal. In addition, noise in MSI datasets might be non-uniform across ions, due to the high dynamic range. By rotating the data to another space, PCA standardizes the noise distribution across components.",
  "All simulations were performed using the sander MD code from the AmberTools23 package. Reference QM/MM calculations were performed using ORCA package. In case of simulations involving the ANI-2x potential, sander was coupled to the emle-engine 31 code. emle-engine implements EMLE embedding and provides an interface to the torchani package implementing the ANI-2x potential. In all cases, the snapshots were used to calculate excitation energies (ΔE) and transition dipole moments (μ T ) at the ωB97X/6-31G(d) level of theory using the timedependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) implementation of QM/MMPol in the development version of Gaussian. For comparison, we also calculated the excited states using the B3LYP hybrid functional. The MMPol environment was described using the Amber pol12 AL polarizable force field, with water charges taken from previous work and polarization-consistent ESP charges for flurbiprofen derived at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory using the Polchat tool. We used MMPol and MM cutoff radius values equal to 15 and 30 Å, respectively. 3MI has two nearly degenerate π-π* excited states that dictate low-energy absorption and fluorescence, termed La and Lb according to the Platt nomenclature. These states were carefully identified in each snapshot from the two lowest-lying excited states based on the orientation of the transition dipoles.",
  "Recent studies of Ir 156 and Pd 157 nanoparticle growth have also concluded that size dependent surface reactivity leads to size distribution focusing. In the case of Pd, the binding and coverage of phosphine ligands was argued to influence the solute attachment kinetics and cause the size focusing. The size dependence of lead oleate binding to PbS, 159 and the size dependent surface reactivity of InP are also thought to determine the polydispersity of those materials.",

In the present work, we investigate with density functional theory (DFT) the reactions of plasma generated radicals H, N, NH, and NH2 with the metal precursor treated Co (001) and (100) surfaces in detail. We use static DFT relaxations at 0 K and ab initio MD simulations at 600 K to explore the chemistry of these radicals and how they remove Cp ligands, NHx species and recover the NHx terminations needed to promote the metal precursor step.",
  "In Figure , we find the reduced low-frequency Raman and the mechanism splitted components in susceptibility form for the MeN. The total spectra consist of at least three main large and strongly overlapped bands followed by a progression of secondary bands above ~ 250 cm -1 . In this case, the anions are expected to carry the most sensitive electronic cloud to the surrounding fluctuations; however, their larger mass puts their contribution in the low-wavenumber part. In fact, the cation spectra display clearly a much more rich and informative spectra. One of the main bands of the total spectra has an overall asymmetric profile and is centered at ~ 40 cm -1 and is mostly related to the slower reorientational movements of the anions. This is reinforced by their greater mass and H-bonds the aforementioned heterogeneity in may be responsible for the asymmetric band shape in this sense. Along the DID contribution, the discrete shoulder in the MeN + contribution appear in the DID contribution as clear and assignable band ate ~220 cm -1 .",

  "To simulate solar UV exposure, the reactor tank was positioned 3 ft underneath a custom-manufactured overhead frame equipped with 6 × 1.5 ft l × w UV lamps (Solarc SolRx, F72T12/BL/HO UV-A bulbs). UVlight intensity was measured daily using a handheld UVA/UVB light meter (Sper Scientific, 850009). UV intensity readings were collected at 6 locations 1 inch above the water level. Evaporation was accounted for by monitoring the liquid level in the raceway pond over the length of the study and adding an equivalent volume of de-ionized water as required to balance evaporative losses.",
  "Simulation of X-ray Powder Diffraction. Atomic models of In 2 S 3 nanoribbons were generated using the Crystal Maker software as follows: a new crystal was created and the corresponding space group, lattice parameters and atomic positions in the unit cell were entered following Pistor et al. The unit cell was expanded along the principal crystallographic directions with ratios 1×10×100. The structure was then exported as an xyz coordinate text file which serves as input for calculation of the X-ray diffractogram using the Debyer program () which calculates the scattering pattern from atomic coordinates using Debye's scattering equation.",
  "Large changes in the spectra with second and third order truncation of the cumulant expansion using the LR-TD-B3LYP S 1 parametrized GBOM suggest substantial changes in PES curvature or a large Duschinsky rotation matrix, with large mixing of normal mode coordinates possibly caused by the decrease in symmetry going from the S 0 C 2v to the LR-TD-B3LYP S 1 C s minimum. In contrast, if the PIMOM method is used to compute S 1 minimum and corresponding Hessian and normal modes, the resulting vibronic spectrum is in excellent agreement with the vertical gradient and AIMD trajectory-based approaches,",
  "However, the calculated λ max for the S 1 at the LC-BLYP/6-311+G(d,p) level of theory is ∼ 43 nm redshifted than the experimental one. But all other properties e.g. dipole moment, oscillator strengths, transition dipole angles agrees well with previously reported data to accurately represent the L a and L b states and their order. Therefore, we have also used LC-BLYP functional along with the B3LYP functional for tryptophan, serotonin and melatonin to calculate their excited state properties which are shown in Table .",

The trained model largely resolved the localization of overlapping NPs, and the proposed pipeline will enable the automation of PSD analysis.",
  "However, we soon realized that the reaction was proceeding even at room temperature, despite the reported high barrier of almost 31 kcal mol -1 for the initial ring-forming step. Additionally, the reaction sped up when exposed to light at room temperature -while maintaining the constant product ratio. This prompted us to explore this reaction further, including revisiting the original n-propyl derivative Diallene-Scheme 1: General scheme of the thermal GB/[1,5]-H shift reaction.",
  "We use TAFFI because it relies purely on quantum chemical calculations for its parameterization and for its computational efficiency; however, we acknowledge that the reported magnitude of NQEs could differ based on the underlying force field. To gain some insight into this sensitivity, classical and PIMD simulations using two different force fields-the all-atom optimized potentials for liquid simul ations (OPLS-AA) force field and Open Force Field (OpenFF, version 2.0.0 with unconstrained bonds)-were also performed and analyzed for a subset of 11 molecules. Simulation procedures were the same as described in General Simulation Protocols.",
  "RIS is a generalized conformational approach dependent on the types of comonomers, as each bond pair is explicitly examined and all energy levels are statistically summed along any specific chain connectivities, e.g., any regio-, stereo-, or comonomer-sequence distributions can be explicitly considered. Thus it has great potential in future studies to explain the more peculiar comonomer sequence dependent Tgp deviations observed for AD-SD type comonomers . In addition, similar to stereosequence dependence of local conformational geometry and subsequently the dynamics of the glass transition process , comonomer sequence dependence of glass transition dynamics of copolymers with tunable chain architectures can be studied in combined experimental and simulation studies which ultimately contribute to the understanding of the molecular bases of polymer glass transition phenomena.",
  "The compensation for the Q factor dependence by ERETIC via a separate channel was studied by deliberately reducing the Q factor of the probe. For a McKay design probe, the Q factor was reduced by placing lossy materials, such as wood, into the transmission line. The molar quantification coefficient K m was determined for 31 P NMR on a hydroxyapatite sample over a large range of Q factors (Figure ). As expected, an excellent compensation is observed.",

  "A common preparation to reach interfacial charge transfer to STO is to provide a defined chemical termination of the interface, which for single crystalline STO is achieved by a harsh wet-chemical treatment in buffered hydrofluoric acid . Fig. shows the evolution of the crys- forms atomic step terraces. Starting with a comparably high surface roughness of RMS ≈ 799 pm, the chemical and thermal treatment leads to an RMS surface roughness of around 685 pm. A faint step terrace structure can be recognized already in the as-transferred membrane, indicating that this morphology is determined already during the initial PLD growth and maintained during the delamination process. Note that etch pitches in the defined surface structure might occur due to the harsh chemical treatment of the sample by HF. However, we observe a decreased surface roughness, indicating a continuous termination and a smooth layer surface is achieved. The line profiles shown as insets in fig. ) confirm the formation of single unit cell step heights. In this process, the BHF treatment primarily etches SrO entities from the surface of the membrane .",
  "The generation performance of MOFFUSION was assessed and compared with several precedent models for MOF generation. SMVAE is a multi-component VAE architecture that used templatebased representation for describing MOFs. MOFDiff 45 is a coarse-grained diffusion model which represented building blocks of MOFs using a coarse-grained manner, further applying assembly algorithm as a post-processing step. GHP-MOFassemble 44 is another diffusion model approach for the generation of MOFs, but it was not considered for comparison as it focused on generating organic linkers, rather than the whole structure, and inserted them into pcu topology with fixed metal nodes.",
  "Nevertheless, eq. 1 was fitted for all temperatures (Fig. and Table ). Given only the partial curves at T = 350 and 373 K, fitting was challenging. Therefore, we used fixed values from Fig. in all fits by extrapolating τfilled, assuming a linear change with temperature, and weighted the values with errors to ensure consistency.",
  "We then tried to verify the reduction of aggregation tendency for fluorophore carrying 4'-phenyl with orthodisubstitutions (heptamethine-X) compared to the parent dye and its mono-substituted derivative. The perpendicular orientation of the 4'-aryl group positions its orthofunctionalities right over the polymethine bridge, which can discourage the close stacking between fluorophores to reduce the aggregation of the fluorophores (Figure ). Previous reports have utilized Zincke salt carrying orthosubstituents to create \"shielded\" Cy7 derivatives for reduced aggregation, which requires lengthy synthesis. A simpler strategy uses Suzuki coupling on the Schiff base to access 4'-(o-methyl)phenyl substitution on a SWIRemitting heptamethine, showing greatly reduced aggregation behavior compared with analog without orthomethyl group; 11 however, the difficulty of synthesizing ortho-disubstituted derivative prevents further exploration of this effect.",
  "Nonetheless, this highlights that the CG correctly stabilises the global minimum, and we do 10.0 kcal mol -1 However, the higher energy regions of the energy landscape are poorly represented, and not consistent with the energy landscape observed for AMBER. On the energy scale presented, we do not observe any fully unfolded structures. We located some such structures in our simulations, but their energies were off the scale. The unfolding structures we located at lower energies 1 maintain hydrogen-bonded base pairs, while we observe large distortions of the backbone. Interestingly, the CG model explores also molecules with an inverted chirality that are found in the high-energy funnel on the left of Fig. . However, contrary to what one may expect, these structures are still connected to the native funnel without adopting unfolded transition states. Instead we observe that the molecule switches conformation while preserving most base pairing while losing stacking an straining torsions.",
  "Strontium iridate (SrIrO 3 ) has recently attracted attention owing to its exceptionally high OER activity proposed to originate through Sr 2+ leaching and surface amorphization. Assuming that Sr 2+ leaching involves electrochemical de-insertion (Path 1 as opposed to Path 2 in Equations S1), electrochemical leaching of Sr 2+ from SrIrO 3 involves two holes (h ⦁ ). The reaction in the Kröger-Vink notation is as follows (see also Equations S1):",
  "A work from Olufsen et al. aimed at understanding the effect of loading conditions on embrittlement and highlighted their importance. In their study, PA11 with and without 6 % BBSA was aged in pH 3 butanoic acid at 120 Three types of responses were considered: brittle failure with no apparent plasticity, ductile failure at necking without cold drawing, and ductile failure after cold drawing. A change from ductile to brittle failure was possible with a constant CIV level, and plasticizer content.",

Plate-like crystals of Li and Na salts of the di-anion 1 2- appeared after few hours. The lithium salt of 1 2-crystallized with one lithium cation coordinated to a vinylene bridge and the second Li + solvent-separated (Fig. ). The molecular formula of this product can be written as [Li + (THF)4][{Li + (THF)3}(1 2-)] and we use the shortened Li2-1 2-(and similarly for other products) throughout the text.",
  "MaterialsAtlas's machine learning algorithm was utilized to predict space group and lattice constant parameters based on input chemical formula BeSeO3. Using the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD), CuSeO3 (ICSD: 29507) was used as a reference structure whose composition was adjusted via VESTA software and exported as a crystallographic information file (CIF) for DFT calculations via quantum espresso with USSP pseudopotentials, PBE exchange-correlation functional, wave function cut off of 50 Ry, 225 Ry charge density cut off and 6-6-6 K points at 160 bands . The XXX-2 density of states (DOS) quantifies the number of available states per energy level in semiconductor materials in order to determine optoelectronic properties such as bandgap, charge carrier concentration, and optical transition probabilities between states. As displayed in Fig. , BeSeO3 is characterized as a wide bandgap material with an associated band gap of 4.34 eV approximately seen between the -3.7-0.8 eV energy level peaks.",
  "where m is a mean function and k is a kernel returning similarity between two points. Therefore, during optimization, the affinity prediction function is assumed to follow a multivariate Gaussian. The BO algorithm implementation in this work relies on the negative expected improvement as acquisition function, which trades off exploration and exploitation to determine the next query point. For each kinase, the optimization process was initiated from 40 initial (random) points in the latent space and the optimization was performed for 30 epochs with 50 calls per epoch with the scikit-optimize 75 package.",
  "Furthermore, the influence of different steps of minimizations was examined using the decoded structure from the point (2, 2). Following similar procedures, it was subjected to 5 steps of steepest descent minimizations followed by 20 steps of ABNR. Seed structures after different The black diamond point and red diamond point on the latent space were not far away from each other (Figure ). The structures after further minimizations did not deviate significantly either. The NVT simulations followed by heating and NPT equilibrations for both seed structures covered similar regions, including much empty space uncovered previously. Thus, the early-stage minimizations already generally minimized the system energy to an acceptable level, and most of the latter made only minor changes, and they had similar capabilities to sample new conformations as seed structures.",
  "The experimental results here provide strong empirical evidence for the 𝜋𝜋 * excitation scheme in Eq. 3. The generation of a p orbital vacancy makes charge transfer to the thiobase energetically favorable even at excitation below the cluster VDE. Our results further indicate that this process is sufficiently rapid to account for IRF limited (sub 80 fs) VB signal rise not only in this system but also in the previous above-VDE excitation energy measurements in which no DB signal was observed.",
  "Calculation of these charge labels grants the opportunity to include a collection of charged MOF structures alongside the more traditionally employed neutral databases. An instance wherein a cationic framework is produced following structure processing is outlined in the supporting information (Figure ). MOSAEC-DB structures ending in \"_p(x)\" or \"_n(y)\" labels possess net framework charges corresponding to either positive | x | or negative | y |, respectively. The computed framework charge labels were verified through a modified version of the structure error analysis protocol described in the upcoming section; therefore, only structures possessing reasonable metal oxidation states upon consideration of their charge label were included. While these charged frameworks may not be appropriate for all situations, inclusion of credible, chargelabelled frameworks allows researchers to study a diverse set of ionic frameworks which were previously neglected in MOF database curation.",
  "What is common to all methods for excited state bonding analysis is that they can be used for exciplex or excimer systems only, where the bonding results from the electronic excitation of one fragment. The reason is that choosing the excited fragment is (mostly) straightforward in these systems while the second fragment stays in the ground state. Our development will follow the same approach. A different angle is taken by Kimber and Plasser : Their approach splits the excitation energy into orbital energy differences, coulomb attraction between hole and electron, repulsive exchange interaction, and exchange correlation (XC)-contributions.",
  "The quantum chemical refinement of a moderate number of SQM poses in combination with an increasing level of description of electronic energies and (implicit) solvation is able to provide very accurate Gibbs energies of binding of drug molecules to CB [8] and β-CD receptors. Machine learning (ML) approaches are now alternatives to obtain such accurate Gibbs energies of binding. For example, for the pillar[n]arene WP6 host-guest binding challenge, ML results trained on extensive experimental datasets were superior. For realistic host-guest complexes , however, training data may be scarce. Here, a ML framework to control the error of DFT calculations may be more appropriate. Our approach is able to provide such computational Gibbs energies of binding that are of comparable accuracy as experimental. It does not require a system-specific force matching or force field parametrization. At every step in this systematic workflow, it also allows the control of accuracy of results and possible ranges of errors",
  "The investigated dynamics and transport properties of different components of the studied DEEs, more specifically the obtained cationic transport numbers and the estimated τ Li-amide /τ R ratios, combined with their viscosity and ionic conductivity trends, suggest a more structural transport mechanism for the lithium ion in the URA electrolyte through exchange of amide molecules. Meanwhile, the vehicular mechanism could have an increasingly larger contribution to lithium ion transport in the ACT and specifically NMA electrolytes.",
  "To instead enable practical TSA synthesis on scale for screening applications, we aimed at regioselective and efficient syntheses of TSA4 and TSA5. We focused on cost-and time-efficiency: using cheap commercial reagents, minimising chromatographic purifications, and reducing the step count. The straightforward syntheses we now provide address the growing need for functionalisable selenenylsulfides in chemical biology and will also fill gaps in organochalcogen chemistry.",
  "In previous studies, increasing the initial substate loading has delivered higher titers ; however, higher substrate loadings would require a proportional increase in nitromethane loadings, which will decrease enzyme performance. An increase in temperature would likely improve the organocatalysed cascade of butyraldehyde to the dinitroalkane while maintaining current nitromethane loadings; however, alcohol oxidase performs optimally at 30°C . Instead, we next investigated how a sequential reaction one-pot reaction compared to a reaction with all reagents added at the onset.",

  "A recent inter-comparison of spatial predictions by six national empirical models reported relatively close agreement among annual-average model predictions . While the inputs and methods differed among models, the dependent data were consistent: publiclyavailable United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) regulatory monitoring station data. That result suggests that, among the approaches they compared, the actual methods might not dramatically influence the resulting annual-average predictions, if the dependent variable is EPA regulatory air pollution measurements.",
  "Finally, the other two megatrends directly affecting the work of doctoral students in chemistry-related disciplines are the marketization of the university, and the global environmental crisis. The former sees universities transforming into market players in which the university acts as a competitive entity in a market wherein ranking lists classify universities chiefly based on research productivity and student evaluation of teachings .",
  "Moreover, the limited release observed in both F3 and F5 formulations further substantiates our hybrid NLC concept. The exceptionally high solubility of CsA in medium chain lipids creates strong CsA-lipid interactions that restrict diffusion from the matrix, while the organised Type I imperfect crystal structures formed through PEG-100 stearate-mediated crystallisation establish physical barriers that further constrain peptide mobility.",

  "The intermolecular charge transfer character of the electronic states was assigned based on the transition density matrix analysis proposed by Plasser et al. The charge transfer numbers defined as partial summations over squared transition density matrix elements of molecular fragments were calculated using the TheoDore 1.5.1 package. These numbers were computed based on the Mulliken type analysis and were used to determine the weight of charge transfer configurations for a given state (denoted as Ω CT ). This quantity vanishes for localized or delocalized Frenkel excitonic states and approaches unity for charge transfer or charge resonance states.",
  "Raman spectra simulations were performed on the optimized molecular geometries. Density Functional Theory (DFT) was employed for the electronic calculations, using the B3LYP exchange-correlation functional.

  "Finally, to enable salt formation, the team decided to replace the alcohol group with an amine. The resulting compound 3 (rimegepant) exhibited an even greater affinity for the binding site compared to the alcohol, presumably due to the additional cation-π binding with W74 RAMP1 . In addition, the new compound exhibited significantly higher bioavailability, resulting in nearly an order of magnitude higher protein-adjusted Ki 1 .

  "Precise structure and composition customization for semiconductor solids on substrates becomes crucial due to their perspectives in energy storage , catalysis , optronics , and biomedicine . Each technology is successful on an industrial scale when the quality of materials being developed is accompanied by an adequate conversion of reactants into desired products. Most traditional approaches for depositing TFs and tailoring their properties are characterized by low conversion efficiency of initial reactants into desired products . Such aspects create a bottleneck in essential chemical processes and require timely adjustments, particularly in setting up global economy fragmentation with technological decoupling and raw material chain failures .",
  "In the limit of zero collisions, no conversion of thermal motion to flow velocity will occur (v SS = 0 and These values deviate slightly from those for a MB distribution (v SS = 0 and T SS = T liq = 289 K), suggesting some collisions occur between the evaporating molecules.

  "For AgAlTe 2 , we calculated the band alignment of the strained structure. The lattice constants a and b were stretched to match the lattice constant of CdTe. To find the pseudo ground-state of the strained structures, we sketched the equation of state by calculating the total energy at different scaling of the c axis. We identified the c axis scaling that minimizes the energy and created slab supercells of the strained structure with elongated a and b and scaled c. The VBM and CBM positions were corrected with band edge shifts calculated from GW quasi-particle energy calculations on the scaled unit cell.",
  "The key to single molecule imaging with InS is to increase the propagation length of SPPs, which leads to the linearly increase of SNR in Eq.(3). A larger L also leads to a sharper ring pattern of scattering field at the back focal plane, and consequently a higher quantum noise removal rate by using a sharper filter (Fig. ). We thus designed the waveguide structure of Si3N4(180 nm)/ Au(50 nm)/glass, which supports multiple SPP modes (Fig. ). The zero order SPPs were stimulated with a 640 nm laser source at incident angle of 61.5 degree (Fig. ).",

  "All quantum chemical calculations were performed using the Orca program package . Geometries of reagents and transition states were calculated at the PBE0-D3/6-311G(d,p)/CPCM level of theory. Water and DMF were used as solvents due to the unavailability of CPCM parametrization for DESs. The nature of local minima was confirmed by frequency calculation. Implicit solvent models cannot be used to describe dissociation of strong acids in water without explicit consideration of the solvation shell, thus we used experimental value of H+ solvation free energy .",

  "To assess the various local minima and saddle points in the potential energy surface of the ethanol coordinated 1 Fe(CO) 4 and to relate to weaker solvent interactions for 1 Fe(CO) 5 and 3 Fe(CO) 4 , a library of structures were formed by optimizing structures in DFT using the TPSSh functional with the def2-TZVP basis set with implicit solvation given by the conductor-like polarizable continuum (CPCM) model 23 using ethanol as solvent. All subsequent cluster calculations include CPCM implicit solvation unless stated otherwise. The possible coordination between the hydroxyl (-OH), alkyl (-HC α or -HC β ) in either an axial or equatorial coordination to Fe(CO) 4 leads to six minima and their corresponding transition states. All optimizations of both the minima and transition states were completed using the Gaussian 16 quantum chemistry suite. For each of the TPSSh/def2-TZVP optimized minima and transition state structures, we assess the BLYP functional used in the AIMD simulations by calculating single point energies in CP2K with the BLYP functional without CPCM.

The slightly modified synthetic pathway gives the opportunity to synthesize similar, spiro or other bulky group substituted CAAC ligands. The complexes showed good catalytic performance compared to the commercially available NHC-containing HG2 and CAAC-derived UNC complexes. The importance of the apparent attachment of the two phenyl rings (with regards to complex 7 versus 6d) and the substituent of the nitrogen atom (6a-c) could be evaluated.",
  "In addition, by conducting the preliminary tests on the recently published mace-mp0 universal force field model, it is evident that although an overall visual trend may appear promising, it is not suitable for this particular application ( with an average RMSE of 0.048 eV (< 0.6 meV/atom total energy) embedded within an intricate network of seven competitive pathways. These errors reveal that the energy difference between competitive reactions should be more than 0.1 eV for reliable conclusions using MLFF, which has been taken into consideration here.",
  "Exposure to a nerve agent can be deadly but as the survival of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, and Alexei Navalny shows, medical treatment can be effective.

Treatment of nerve agent exposure is typically threefold ; [AS07]:",
  "The Astral analyzer also imposes a particular demand on the detector as ions are accumulated in an ion trap prior to pulseextraction into the analyze . Unlike traditional orthogonal extractors, such extraction traps have no issues with duty cycle or transmission, but operate with a slower repetition rate, for example with 200 Hz instead of ~10 kHz. This means that a single shot must have sufficient ions to generate a full mass spectrum, up to 50,000 ions per cycle and even thousands of ions in one species arriving at the same time at the detector. This imposes a challenging requirement for dynamic range, where detectors matched to an 8, or more recently 10-bit analogue to digital convertor (ADC) might manage barely 2 orders of magnitude dynamic range .",
  "stoloniferum QY2-10 isolated from an unidentified sea squirt collected from the bay of Jiaozhou, China led to the isolation of two previously unreported derivatives, namely stoloniferols A-B (96-97) (Figure ).

  "The harmonic phonon dispersion of γ-Bi 2 Sn 2 O 7 is evaluated using the supercell finitedisplacement method with the Phonopy package. Imaginary harmonic modes in the dispersion indicate dynamical instabilities in the form of collective atomic displacements that lower the energy. We use the ModeMap code to map the energy as a function of the normal-mode coordinate Q (distortion amplitude) along the imaginary-mode eigenvectors and to locate the energy minimum along the mode. This structure is then relaxed and a subsequent phonon calculation performed to check for additional imaginary modes. Repeating this procedure iteratively across all the imaginary modes in the parent γ and child structure(s) until each branch terminates in a dynamicallystable structure with no imaginary modes allows the sequence of intermediate structures connecting the γ and low-temperature α-phases to be systematically enumerated while also identifying other (meta-)stable polymorphs.",
  "Energy-minimization and geometry optimization of the structures was achieved using the Merck Molecular Force Field (MMFF94) using the Open Babel module of PyRx software . Fortunellin was docked at the active binding pockets of the SARS-CoV-2 protein targets employing a grid-based docking method opting for a rigid protein receptor and flexible ligand docking protocol. The coordinates of the grid boxes were adjusted in x, y, and z dimensions according to the known active site of the proteins. Molecular docking was achieved using the AutodockVina software .

  "These P/N doped D-A helicenes show folded molecular conformation and unique photo-electro-magnetic properties that are distinct from the reported carbon[n]helicene analogs and traditional triarylated ammonium radicals. The tunable blue to NIR emission and chiral-induced CPL are achieved by controlling the D-A charge-transfer strength and ionic solubility. Importantly, the dynamic polar-dependent electron transfer is formed by modulating the HLCT process from topological symmetry (ζPET up to 67.8), but the symmetric PDCs do not have this feature. In addition, the chemical oxidative diradicals show a counterintuitive persistence with high diradical character (y0 = 0.989). Consequently, this family of D-A phosoha[n]helicenes could serve as a promising platform to enforce polar diradical design and functionalization in the future.",
  "A subsequent weight loss takes place upon further heating and is difficult to assign to a specific weight loss step, signifying framework decomposition. In situ variable-temperature powder Xray diffraction (VT-PXRD) studies also revealed that the diffraction pattern of BAM-1 remained almost unchanged except lowering the intensity below 190°C (Figure ). Upon further heating, the crystallinity of the framework is highly reduced and transformed to an unidentified non crystalline product after the loss of all coordinated and guest water molecules.",
  "All calculations were carried out with ORCA 5.0.4. Geometry optimisations were performed at the B3LYP 62,63 -D3(BJ) /def2-TZVP 66 level of theory. Vertical excitation energies for all 28 TD-DFT methods were calculated without reoptimisation. The Ahlrichs def2-TZVP basis set was used for these single point calculations. The conductor-like polarizable continuum solvent model (CPCM) was employed both during geometry optimisations and subsequent calculations; see Section 1 of ESI for information on the specific solvents. † The self consistent field (SCF) convergence criterion was set to 10 -7 E h , the geometry convergence criterion to ORCA's default setting, which includes a change of total energy less than 5 •10 -6 E h .",
  "The selection of an appropriate XCF is certainly a challenge in TD-DFT, especially to correctly predict accurate energies or relative energies of states of different nature. Because of this, our calculations below always rely on the use of SCS-ADC(2)/def2-TZVP energies computed on top of the respective TDA-XCF/6-311G(d,p) optimized geometries. Therefore, the focus is set on assessing the performances of different functionals for the quality of the optimized geometries, Hessian matrices, and associated couplings. As mentioned above, five different XCFs including both global and range-separated hybrids with various admixture of exact exchange have been used",
  "Plots in Fig. show evidence of the exceptional stability of the reduced NiGraf catalyst RGO@Ni, that entirely retains its selective activity in five consecutive reaction runs, affording full conversion of NB to aniline. NiGraf, on the other hand, shows an abrupt drop in activity after the 3 rd run, whereas nanoparticulate Ni loses activity already after the 2 nd run.",
  "While scaling relationships do not easily generalize quantitatively to WOCs with distinct electronic states, qualitative inferences about the activity of possible TMCs were possible based on the sign of deviations from the scaling relationships. These observations motivated predictions of the role of rigidity in a Ru complex with more flexible ligands and a Ru SAC analogue. This approach reveals properties that govern the activity of homogeneous WOCs and provides a route toward computational design of improved catalysts for water oxidation.",
  "Another important finding is that the active site models even outperformed the full sequence models when both models were pretrained on full sequences. While the difference between both configurations is lower in this setting, this result suggests that proteochemoet-ric models benefit from pretraining on large-scale pan-protein data even if the final use case is limited to one family. Last, we compared both models (KNN and BiMCA) to state-ofthe-art on the same datasets from Karimi et al. and found that our models obtain similar and partly superior performance to all existing approaches.",

All calculations begin with a 2D structure of Cu29 adsorbed on the various Ru-modified TaN surfaces and we explore how the structure evolves during either 0 K relaxations and MD simulations at finite temperature.

The tested G12 guest (Hexamethyladamantane-2,6diammonium) has the 2 and 6 carbon atoms of the R type. The Force Field (FF) parameters and topology of the host and guests molecules were prepared using the PrimaDORAC interface based on the GAFF2 parameter set. For G4, the silicon-related parameters were taken from Ref. The initial bound state was prepared using the Autodock Vina code. The bound complexes and the ghost ligands were solvated in about 1600 and 512 OPC3 water molecules, respectively. Long-range electrostatic interactions were treated using the Smooth Particle Mesh Ewald method (SPME). A background neutralizing plasma was assumed within the SPME method.

  "We also tested Milstein's Ru-PNN trans-dihydride 3Py and obtained TON = 1-3 with or without light, but 3Py is known to spontaneously lose H2 when standing in solution at r.t., and we found that even the chlorido precursor to 3Py (i.e. 1Py) produces hydrogen when irradiated in anhydrous benzene, so the comparison is rather inconclusive. We also note that irradiation of Ru-MACHO and 3Py with broad band light resulted in solutions containing a multitude of hydride resonances in the 1 H NMR spectrum and speciation by 31 P{ 1 H} NMR was complicated. Therefore, careful studies is necessary to infer the action of light on these systems which is outside the scope of this current study. Rather, our current studies on 3 and 4 provide a working hypothesis for future combined coordination and photochemical investigations, namely that photoisomerizations of TMH is a new photoswitch that can be used for acceptorless alcohol dehydrogenation.",
  "For preparation of CReM fragment databases we used structures from ChEMBL22 . Structures were curated according to the protocol based on Chemaxon Standardizer [38]: i) salts were removed and molecules were neutralized, ii) chemotypes were standardized, iii) duplicates were removed. We kept only compounds containing the following atoms: C, N, O, S and halogens. The collected initial dataset consisted of 1 554 260 structures. Further a subset of molecules was reduced by removing molecules matching at least one of structural alert from the set of BMS, Dundee, Glaxo, Inpharmatica and PAINS filters as implemented by Pat Walters - . As we demonstrated previously, removal of such molecules before fragment database creation guarantees generation of molecules having no such patterns if the size of patterns does not exceed the chosen context radius . This reduced the data set size to 818 174 molecules. Further we defined subsets of molecules with restricted synthetic accessibility (SA) values as predicted by the approach of Ertl and Schuffenhauer . We chose values 2 and 2.5 as reasonable thresholds while the average SA score for all ChEMBL22 compound was 3.0 and the median score was 2.73. This gave subsets with 67 970 and 338 422 molecules, respectively. These sets of molecules were exhaustively fragmented and converted to CReM fragment databases (Table ).",

  "Multi-step performance. We performed multi-step route planning for 936 targets from the ChEMBL database and an in-house selection of 791 AZ compounds. These compounds were previously used to benchmark the general retrosynthesis model, but the multi-step retrosynthesis failed to provide routes that lead to purchasable starting materials when only using the general model. For these compounds, the set of leaf compounds for the top-ranked predicted route contained at least one compound with a chiral center.

  "The release rate was controlled by adjusting the ow path to dierent sized precision orice ow restrictors, and could be ne tuned by adjusting an upstream regulator. The regulator could be bypassed to achieve higher release rates, or when operating from a low pressure gas supply system such as a conditioned fuel gas system post regulation. (SI Figures S-7 and S-8). ChRs were metered by a Fox FT2 mass ow meter calibrated for the range of controlled release experiments. Timestamped release rate data was logged at 1 hz by an on board microcomputer, and the location of each release point was manually recorded by the study team. The release rig was manually controlled to provide a continuous emission at a constant emission rate for the duration of a release and only a single ChR was conducted at a time. Multiple ChRs were sometimes conducted in succession from the same ChR location using dierent release rates for dierent durations.",
  "Counter to the above points regarding the scale-up of batch processes, the impact of mixer design and channel geometries for small scale applications in flow are well known to both chemistry and chemical engineering audiences.

This suggests that our current data mixture, while effective for the smaller model architecture, may need further optimization to fully leverage the increased representational capacity of the 14B parameter scale .",
  "As discussed in Sec. II D, we are currently using a canned Interpolation routine that requires extending our Crystal grid out into a fully rectangular lattice. The cost to evaluate the (constant) energy value for each new lattice point is trivial compared to each Crystal lattice point PES evaluation.

It is worth exploring this in some detail for our three application systems.",

  "For this system, both the b2f2 and cb3f3 ERSs were used, resulting in 264 and 103 distinct enumerated products, respectively. 167 of these products satisfied a ∆H r threshold of 80 kJ/mol and were used for low-level TS localization and characterizations. Reactions with ∆G † < 50 kcal/mol were downselected for high-level characterization (See SI section 3 for additional dis-cussion of G † filtering). After filtering and downselecting, 84 reactions were characterized at the B3LYP-D3/TZVP level, requiring 1355 DFT level gradient calls and achieving an intended rate of 33.3% (28/84).

Our prior work has shown that the model explicitly couples the FTC ----ETC + C reaction to the shuttling ring motion, with shuttling much faster than catalysis as in the experimental motor . We have also shown that the mean current can be flipped between the clockwise and counterclockwise orientations with structural changes , and statistical fluctuations in the current decrease with increasing FTC consumption .",
  "In this work, we developed a workflow for refining docked poses by utilizing a specialized small-system MD engine, mdgx from the AmberTools. Our aim is to simulate just the residues around the binding site, thereby better sampling the conformational space that would be of interest. Because of the tiny simulation system and the induced-fit nature, we refer to this workflow as \"tinyIFD\". Originally designed for ligand parameter generation, the mdgx code utilizes individual streaming multiprocessors (SMs, 80 on an NVIDIA V100) on a GPU card to perform as many simulations in parallel, which generates a high throughput when system size is small enough. The size of the shared memory of the GPU card imposes a limit on the system size to 928 atoms, which amounts to the simulation of a ligand and about 65 residues surrounding it. We describe the strategy to prepare such a receptor core-ligand complex for simulations, measure the simulation throughput and show it only consumes modest computational resources.",

For open-pore unit cells, optimization was carried out under a fixed volume constraint; while lattice parameters and ionic positions were permitted to adjust, the volume remained constant, consistent with the ISIF=4 setting in VASP. In contrast, closed unit cells underwent a comprehensive optimization encompassing volume adjustments to ensure the system attained the global electronic energy minimum, represented by the ISIF=3 setting in VASP, as shown in our earlier work .",
  "1) to enhance peak separation peaks, we conducted the operando measurement again using a setup optimized for XRPD measurements, by the detector placed further away from the sample. However, under these conditions, the results of the PCA, as depicted in Figure , revealed higher fluctuations in the score values. This suggests the presence of random differences among sequentially collected measurements, likely attributable to extended path (1411 mm) travelled by scattering photons before reaching the detector. This extended path severely impedes the detection of trends in data across the operando measurements.",
  "In particular in the high exciton-number transient absorbance spectrum shown in Figure , a spectrally broad photo-induced absorption (PA) is visible at photon energies below the band-edge transition. As discussed in more detail in Supporting Information S3, this PA scales proportional to the exciton number, and exhibits the same decay dynamics as the band-edge bleach. Similar PA bands were reported for CdSe and PbSe QDs, and assigned to absorption from surfacelocalized defects or intraband absorption, while a recent study on InP QDs related this PA feature to transitions involving conduction-band electrons. 27",
  "We aim to show how the pose classifiers can filter out obviously incorrect poses (i.e., false positives of the molecular docking process) and weak-binding compounds which are mis-calculated by docking programs as strong binders.

  "The nature and strength of the metal-ligand chemical bond reveals strong spin-state dependencies due to which a few associated molecular vibrations reflect a spin-state dependent response. The NRVS peaks at the low wavenumber region (0-250 cm -1 ) for these complexes arises due to the normal modes with out-of-plane motion of the iron atom and shows significant response towards the substitution of the peripheral group. The spin state sensitive vibrational modes consisting of the in-plane motion of iron atom arise at higher wavenumbers (¿ 250 cm",
  "The assignment was supported by quantum-chemistry estimates of vertical attachment energy using MP2 and DFT. Later, Oliveira et al. carried out scattering calculations with the Schwinger multichannel (SMC) method, confirming the presence of the two π resonances and also reporting two high-lying σ * resonances. Note than no evidence of the σ * resonances was observed in the ET experiments . A more recent ET experiments 30 confirmed the previous assignments and additionally reported a sharp feature around 0.5 eV, which was attributed to a vibrational Feshbach resonance (along the NH stretching mode) due to a putative virtual state. Table in the SI shows resonance peak positions reported by the previous studies .",
  "The performance of InS suggests that the integral detection of in-plane scattering SPP fields surpasses the quantum noise limit without increased optical intensity.

  "MD simulations had confirmed the most preferred type of molecular structures in NS. Long, linear hydrogen acceptors containing multiple 1,2-diamine units could tightly associate with polyacid chains thereby efficiently guide their assembly under moderate osmotic pressure (0.1 MPa). For example, in AAc-PEHA system, the polymer significantly curled under pressure by forming many sites with obvious atomic clustering (fig. ). The volumetric shrinkage under pressure reached ~37%, which was much greater than the simulated result for AAc-TEMED system and well-matched our experimental findings (Fig. ).",
  "Application of method 3 for achiral Schwarzite synthesis, such as P215-C192 (Scheme 6), brings the complexity down to 1. Six bonds must be created during the single cyclization step (Scheme 7). Molecular modeling shows that two intermediates, 15 and 16, adopt the hemisphere shape required for cyclization after aromatization of not-so-much curved 13 and 14. Both reactions can be done in one pot since there is a literature precedent of Pd(OAc)2 catalyzed oxidative Heck process coupled with dehydrogenation by DDQ. Each of the two types of trimers in P215-C192, structures 11 and 12 dubbed by students in our lab \"Lilo and Stitch\" 58 are surrounded by three trimers of the other kind as emphasized through illustration on Scheme 6. Worth mentioning, there are achiral Schwarzites, P204-C216, P221-C240, P221-C288, but their tiling is chiral with two options of different enantiomeric trimers of type 1. Method 3 is applicable to other Schwarzites synthesis, even looking so challenging as P207-C56(2222) composed of octagons sharing edges (Fig. , Scheme 8). The unit cell synthesis in this case gets complexity index 1, but it must create octagons when joining unit cells, possibly, by the Ullmann reaction, as well as dehydrogenate sp atoms in each corner of the unit cell. Interestingly, changing the trans position of Br atom to the cis makes P207-C56(1^8) Schwarzite (Scheme S2), which is unstable according to DFT computation.",

  "The oil-nanofiller interface is a perfect contact; devoid of any abrupt discontinuities in physical features (so that critical theories of grain-boundary or grain resistance is neglected). Now, when the suspension is subjected to high electrical stresses, a copious number of charges (streamer charges) gets injected in the medium. The interfacial states act as sinks of those charges and holds them. The sinks can be of deep or shallow type, depending on the conductivity (𝞼) and permittivity (ɛ) differences of both oil and the nanofiller. A shallow trap can accommodate a streamer charge for a short span and de-trap it easily. While a deep trap stores the charges for a longer time and can create permanent electrets . Presence of these traps and accumulation of charges in the interface states (also known as MWS region , trap sites ) gives rise to a layer wise charge distribution -surface layer, stern layer & diffuse layer, referred as Electrical double layer (EDL) having thickness in the range of 2 to 9 nm .",

  "Finally, it is worth noting the difference between HB2DES and other methods of monitoring displacements between excited state vibrational modes, such as stimulated Raman scattering in the time (ISRS) or frequency domain e.g. femtosecond stimulated Raman scattering, and transient 2DES spectroscopies. Differently from these formally six-wave mixing (χ ) experiments, in which the initial actinic pulse is not involved in the preparation of ground and excited state nuclear wavepackets, coherent modulation of the Sn←S1 ESA detected in the χ 2DES must arise from wavepacket dynamics initiated by the pump pair. Thus, in HB2DES a null displacement along a coordinate between S1←S0 will prevent wavepacket dynamics in both the GSB+SE and ESA regions. Conversely, the observation of coherent dynamics in higher excited (or photochemical product) states by HB2DES directly implicates wavepacket generation initiated in the pump step.",
  "Once formed, it remains throughout the whole simulation. At 300 K, one to two such defects are formed per UC for three water loadings considered (48, 96 and 192 waters). At 400 K as much as six defects are formed with 48 waters per UC, however, with 192 waters per UC barely one defects forms which is fast healed. In the former simulation we even observe a propagation of the 3-RNL defect, where two such defects are formed next to each other (Figure ).

  "The Mössbauer signal arising only under operando conditions, D4, is explained by ② (several structural and electronic configurations are accessible, see Tables ), or ③ (IS). The thermodynamic profiles show that dioxygen binding in models with pyrrol-ic N-donors is favorable under any applied potential (Figures ), in contrast to the pyridinic case discussed above. The first PCET step is affected by the applied potential and is favorable under the operando conditions applied here, i.e. 200 mV. Even without known kinetic barriers, assigning D4 as an O2-or OOHbound intermediate is fully consistent with the notion that this species must accumulate before the RDS along the associative ORR pathway, most likely linked to O-O bond breaking. Notably, H2O as an additional axial ligand does not significantly influence the spectroscopic signature (H2O-FeN4C12, Figure ).",
  "Ensemble methods capture model uncertainty (epistemic uncertainty) by employing varied model architectures or different parameter initializations, allowing models to converge to distinct local minima on the energy landscape.

  "In addition, we calculated bond dissociation energies (BDE) on an opened D3 molecule by BCl3 (see ESI, Table and . This boron to gallium Cl transfer reaction also impacts the geometry at Si that evolves from tetrahedral to distorted trigonal pyramid. We present a universal chemical depolymerization for all silicone waste, including elastomers with fillers, which represent a substantial fraction (>40%) of post-consumer waste. This strategy advantageously uses the thermodynamic lever of B-Cl / B-O bonds exchange that offsets the supposedly unfavorable Si-O/B-Cl to Si-Cl/B-O conversion by -15 kcal/mol. The side-product of recycling is thus boron oxide B2O3, a raw material oxide for borosilicate glass. Ga catalysis favors the transformation by lowering the activation energy ~10 kcal/mol, which corresponds to a ~ 36million-fold (3.6x10 7 ) kinetic enhancement.

  "The first term of BGM kernel in Equation 8 is data-driven, while the second term, as defined in Equation , incorporates the Boltzmann distribution of a potential function originated from a meaningful physics model, thus, rendering the score matching objective physics-informed. To perturb each ground truth structure x s in the dataset, we use the BGM kernel instead of an isotropic Gaussian noise, i.e., sample noisy structures x from distribution q σ0,β (x|x s ) rather than the vanilla Gaussian distribution p N (xs,σ 2 0 I) . Then a similar group-optimized score matching loss can be employed to learn the denoising process. As a result, the model learned with BGM kernel will generate physically preferable conformations with relatively low energy.",
  "The trained model was tested by calculating the embedding energies corresponding to the non-covalent complex formed by the PF-00835231 inhibidor and SARS-CoV-2 main protease, previously studied by our group (see Ramos et al. for details). This system serves as a good test case for an embedding model: the ligand has relatively rich chemistry, including polar, non-polar, aromatic groups and heterocycles. The MM environment includes charged, polar and neutral groups, and the ligand is partially exposed to the bulk solvent (Figure ). 100 evenly spaced snapshots from a 1µs long MD trajectory were taken and single point",

  "Nevertheless, we demonstrate here that experimentally evaluated conformational ensembles and dynamics of multidomain proteins with IRDs can be achieved also with alternative strategy using currently available force fields and computational resources.

QEBSS will then select the best solution among the produced data.",
  "The tolerance of CO methanation was investigated based on the idea of a buffer zone in the operated reactors. The experimental investigation was conducted using single pulse reaction experiments. The ratio between disturbance and catalyst capacity was varied investigating different amounts of Ni/Al2O3 catalyst with metal loadings of 2 and 5 wt.-%. Importantly, an internal standard was used in order to discriminate the residence time distribution and the effect of sorption and reaction processes at the solid surface in the measured temporal response. Furthermore, the analysis of the measured data is based on a carbon balance valid under the transient conditions induced by the injection of pulses into the reactive system.",
  "Our synthesis began with the multigram scale preparation of known lactone 21 via Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of commercially available ketone 20 (Scheme 1). Methylenation of the lactone moiety to exocyclic enol ether 18 could be effected in moderate yield (36%) using the Tebbe reagent. Given the cost of commercial solutions of Tebbe reagent and inconsistent results with in situ generation protocols, we developed a two-step sequence for larger scale preparation of 18. This involved initial lactone dichloromethylenation to 22 using PPh3/CCl4 10 followed by dechlorination under Birch conditions. This provided a means to access 18 on multigram scale in higher overall yield (60% over 2 steps). With 18 in hand, [3+2] cycloaddition with a nitrile oxide generated in situ from chlorooxime 11 gave key spirocycle 23 in 58% yield.",

  "In order to determine the Mg-ion migration barriers for the single-ion migration path between two tetrahedral sites passing the octahedral site, the nudged elastic band (NEB) method has been applied in the low vacancy limit. In detail, we removed just one migrating cation within the supercell, for example resulting in a Mg 0.875 B 2 S 4 stoichiometry of the spinel compounds. In all binary and ternary compounds, a sufficiently large supercell has been chosen for the NEB calculations to ensure a negligible interaction between the periodic images of the migrating ions.

  "Except for MeOH, post-irradiated solutions contain 3 and 4 as the major species indicating their overall stability in the catalytic system (Figure ); the carbonylated byproduct 8 is a minor component (tentative structure shown in Scheme 5, Figure ). We propose that the first step is the reversible photo-induced isomerization of 3 to 4. The salient component of the mechanism is the enhanced lability of PPh3 and/or CO in 4 because the of trans-effect of the hydride ligand and/or steric crowding from the cis-diphosphine motif. The lability enhancement allows for alcohol coordination and subsequent liberation of H2 from proposed intermediate 9. Loss of H2 from 9 forms the proposed coordinatively unsaturated species 10, which is predisposed to undergo beta-hydride elimination and ligand recoordination reforming 3; thus, the dehydrogenation is an inner sphere mechanism and no MLC steps are necessary.",
  "Shorter flight times necessitate larger extraction and acceleration voltages that in turn increase the noise duration, at the same time reducing the flight time for the H + ions, eventually rendering their detection impossible.

  "This enables the two types of transitions to be differentiated by their distinct photoelectron angular distributions. The 5 ! ! sequence band exhibits complicated structure completely unlike what is seen for ν1. Much of this structure is assigned to symmetry-forbidden transitions to neutral vibrational states that can be accessed via detachment from the vibrational ground state. Comparison to theory shows the neutral 5 1 state is mixed with other nearby neutral states, leading to fractionation of the sequence band intensity, and this effect is shown to be much more significant in H2CC than D2CC.",

  "Our results point also to a correlation between chemical complexity and switching mechanism. With increasing Sc content, the Al 1-x Sc x N alloy departs from the collective mechanism that is observed in pure AlN to the individual mechanism, which is possibly triggered by larger local distortions produced by Sc. To better understand this correlation, we turn to multinary compounds where the additional effects of site disorder are absent. We first revisit the commonly assumed pathway for wurtzite-type materials and then present an in-depth analysis of individual switching mechanism in multinary compounds.",

  "Upon considering other potential edge effects, this does mean that polymer signal from OCT media can be largely avoided if tissue borders are not analyzed. This is a controversial point, as analysis beyond the tissue margins allows for quality assurance of matrix deposition and understanding delocalization stemming from embedding. The washed tissues (Figure ) also show reduced leeching, with the last detectable polymer in the tissue margin 100 µm less than tissues without the washing procedure completed (Figure ). Regardless, the presence of these larger polymer series on tissue or off tissue after the wash does indeed reveal that this was not a complete removal. Unfortunately, we also did observe that washing increased lipid delocalization in comparison to the control, with roughly 50 µm delocalization of signal observed (Figure ). Generally, while this procedure minimized remnant artifacts from OCT embedding, this delocalization is another consideration for different tissue types. While this can likely be minimized with decreased exposure, this would also result in less extraction of polymers. This ammonium washing protocol did work especially well in negative ion mode analyses, which is a further recommendation for experimental design in these expanded mass ranges.",

Based on the previous knowledge in the field, all the aforementioned data were interpreted as evidence of a tunneling-hopping transition.

This allows for the production of DPA-incorporated HP crystallites irrespective of the selection of 3D endmembers, as confirmed via electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) (Figure ).

Biotransformation lysates should be produced in mass spectrometry compatible buffers, with no or limited ionic detergents avoiding other excipient compounds that lead to ion suppression .",

  "In particular, the surrounding G8 residue is pulled out from the catalytic site, releasing its respective HBs with A-1 and G+1 (Figure , left panel), which allows for the phosphate rotation. When such an event occurs, G8 cannot assure its structural role and the number of accessible active site conformations increases. Among these fluctuations, aligned and tight conformations a priori prone to an addition reaction appear (Figure , right panel). However, it is crucial to notice here that these transient arrangements are not accompanied by an H-bond pattern that would correspond to the expectations of a dianionic general acid/base mechanism, especially because G8 is not close enough anymore. The A-1 sugar pucker is consistently in the C3'-endo conformation. These rather surprising observations may suggest that the DES-Amber force field may not be the most adequate choice to study the HpR behavior.",

  "Role of substituents on phosphorus. We noted that that the catalytic conditions were nearly identical to the synthetic conditions used to prepare 1 and 2 (compare Scheme 1 and Scheme 3) and hypothesized that the catalyst could form in situ. This was tested by performing the reaction under optimized conditions except allowing the catalyst to be generated [a] Consumption (cons.) of dpa and yield of transstilbene (conv.) were determined using GC.

  "Many other kinetically accessible unintended reactions were discovered, albeit not the overall lowest barrier reaction as in the previous cases (All products can be found in the SI). This demonstrates that the combination of DES and partial single-ended exploration (via unintended channels involving the reactants) can increase the reaction coverage rate while avoiding the significant increase in computational cost by performing brute-force b3f3 or even b4f4 enumeration. A more detailed comparison of applying b2f2 and b3f3 ERSs to PC decomposition is provided in SI section 5.",
  "We also explored non-covalent interactions, especially the HB network of water at the Fhwater interface. These interactions influence the structure and dynamics at the solid-water interface , impacting geochemical processes such as crystallization and isotopic fractionation .

  "Even the exploration of the potential energy surface (PES) with polarizable or machine learning (ML) force fields (FFs) , as well as the recent 4 th generation high dimensional neural network (HDNN) potentials , relies heavily on the electrostatic energy of atomic charges. We recently expanded the application of atomic charges with the atomin-molecule adaptation of contracted Gaussian atomic orbital (atomic orbitals (AOs)) basis functions: With a variationally optimized charge and coordination number dependence of the contraction coefficients, the charge-dependent (polarized) valence single-ζ (q-vSZP) basis set includes the essential \"breathing\" of the contracted AOs. Consequently, q-vSZP with the range-separated hybrid (RSH) density functional approximation ωB97X-D4 achieves a remarkable WTMAD-2 of 13.0 kcal mol -1 on the large GMTKN55 database, far outperforming other minimal (i.e., single-ζ ) basis sets. Designed as a deeply contracted minimal basis (MB), q-vSZP is ideal for semiempirical quantum mechanical (SQM) methods and lays the foundation for our current development of a next-generation extended tight-binding (TB) method (working title: g-xTB) to succeed the widely used GFN2-xTB .",

  "For a transition dipole moment ( D) to be non-zero, the selection rule L=±1 applies, and there must be spatial overlap between the initial and final states. Consequently, we can take advantage of the localised nature of the initial core-state and approximate a XANES spectrum using a partial density of states (p-DOS) corresponding to a dipole-allowed transition from the initial core orbital. For the sulphur K-edge, this corresponds to electronic transitions from s ! p orbitals on the absorber and therefore the spectrum can be approximated as the sulphur p-orbital DOS. Within this approximation, our p-DOS descriptor is obtained by extracting the absorber's atomic orbital contribution to each unoccupied molecular orbital, which is obtained using a guess (non-optimised) electronic configuration of the system. We express the guess molecular orbital configuration as in Equation :",

  "In the context of DimeNetPP, the intricate nature of predict- ing Hydrocortamate is rooted in its elevated second and thirdorder chi indices. The elevated chi indices originating from the intricate and extensive interatomic connectivity patterns within the molecule give rise to heightened structural complexity, consequently posing a challenge for precise predictions using the DimeNetPP model. The predictive performance of DimeNetPP is compromised when dealing with larger molecules compared to those present in the training set, primarily due to data limitations, particularly concerning higher Chi indices. Conversely, Alectinib's molecular configuration encompasses a diverse array of bond types, resulting in a heightened BertzCT value. This heightened complexity poses a challenge for SWANI in precisely forecasting Alectinib's properties, thereby highlighting the inherent difficulty in AEV-based feature engineering when modeling molecules containing an assortment of bond and atom types.",

  "Note: during the final stages of this manuscript preparation, we noticed the publication of a related tool, Autobench, by the group of Cormanich. Both Autobench and FASTCAR are devised to ease the exploration of the conformational degrees of freeedom and exploit the molecular similarity (evaluated by RMSD) to reduce computational effort. They however differ in objective: in the case of Autobench, the aim is to further ease methods benchmarking, while FASTCAR aims at facilitating conformational analysis along reaction profiles. This difference of objective results in difference in the geometry pruning, as we here additionally include a selection criterion based on the norm of the imaginary mode. This allow us to avoid misguiding towards inappropriate geometries (typically local maxima associated to a methyl rotation, likely to appear for complex molecular species). We additionally noticed during our development that the use of an invariant RMSD code was extremely useful to further reject equivalent structures, hence the choice of SpyRMSD -which does not seem to be involved in AutoBench.",
  "The acceptance of Qiu's recent publication in this journal on an organo-mediated deuteration of styrenes filled us with surprise because of many familiar, direct methods that are present in literature. Qiu and coworkers put the focus on lessexplored reductive organo-mediators and ignored at the same time the existence of direct methods including our recently published work. From an ethics of science point of view, we find this manuscript questionable for several reasonsespecially because of the lack of referencing which arguably led to the selling of this work as high impact (vide infra). Before detailing a comparison between existing direct styrene reductions and the work from Qiu et al., we want to highlight other related reactions that are feasible by direct and mediated means and thereby clarify that a SET mediator does not change the core mechanistic concept (Scheme 2).",

  "The radical ring-opening polymerization (RROP) of suitable cyclic monomers provides access to (co-)polymers featuring heteroatom backbone functionality including cleavable groups. RROP unfolds its full potential in combination with the architectural control offered by reversible deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) methods. Especially the combination of cyclic ketene acetals with RAFT polymerization has been exploited to prepare materials with high functional group tolerance, stimulus responsiveness, tailored architectures, and predictable backbone degradability. However, cyclic ketene acetals have disadvantages. They show slow copolymerization behavior due to the high energy of the intermediate acetal carbon-based radical and usually need to be fed in excess to force incorporation during copolymerizations of 'moreactivated' (meth)acrylic monomers. Furthermore, the resulting backbone ester groups require harsh, non-selective degradation conditions.",

  "The rise in thermal conductivity is attributed to the rise in the rate of phonon transport in the medium. For nano-suspensions, the molecular liquid layering at the interface acts as the bridge of ballistic heat transfer. The nature (smoothness) of the interface is hence of immense importance. In this experiment, 2D f-BNNs, owing to its higher aspect ratio, thinness (5nm, 10-12 layers) and lipophilic nature provides a large smooth interface; which enables restriction free propagation of acoustic phonons facing low Kapitza resistance . With rising temperature, the molecules in the nanostructures tremble about their mean site and the contribution of Brownian motion in heat transfer gains merit . Apart from the morphology, hexagonal phase of the dispersed material has played its role in providing consent to long range phonon transfer along the c-axis of hexagonal unit cell .",

  "Rate calculations, committor analysis, and order parameter assessment: Nucleation rates are computed using our recently developed jumpy forward flux sampling algorithm , employing the largest crystalline nucleus size as the CV. In the HS system, we monitor the CV every 20 steps, consistent with the coarsegrained FFS variant described in Ref. . The metastable fluid basin is sampled for a minimum of 5 × 10 5 σ m/ , and each FFS iteration ends after at least 3, 000 successful crossings. System sizes are chosen conservatively to avoid finite size artifacts, as using earlier heuristics rely on the efficacy of the underlying CV, which is generally unknown a priori. Committor probabilities are computed by launching 50 trajectories per configuration with randomized velocities drawn from the Boltzmann distribution. To generate configurations with diverse p c 's, short trajectories with periodic outputs are initiated from the configurations used for generating the p c distributions of Figs. and.

  "Computational Details: Geometries of all studied structures were optimized in the gas phase without any geometric constraints using density functional theory (DFT) as implemented in the Gaussian16 code. The M06-L 36 functional was employed. The molybdenum center was described using the def2-TZVPP basis set, while all the other centers were described using the def2-SVP basis set. Default convergence criteria were used in electronic structure and geometry relaxations. Computation of vibrational frequencies confirmed all structures to be minima on the potential energy surface. Gibbs free energies were calculated at 298.15 K and 1.0 atm. Some PTM clusters considered for the DFT calculations contain reduced Mo centers, so those species have the possibility of multiple spin multiplicities.

Thus, the slower polarization-transfer buildup curves observed for Cp149 compared to Cp183 cross peaks are either attributed to their lower proton abundance in the NTD (only isolated Arg are labelled there, whereas in the CTD they cluster together) or to reduced NOE effects (Figure ). It clearly follows from the above observations that line broadening beyond detection is not causing the loss of the resonances in the CP spectra.",

  "Experimental emission spectra and accompanying theory work evince communication between LE and CT states, where the charge-transfer state is formed by linker*-to-node hole transfer (Scheme 2). This notion is substantiated by node protonation influencing emission despite the node not being part of the absorbing chromophore. However, the high-pH spectral contributor (Fig. , Species 3) extracted through target analysis does not perfectly match the theoretical LE lineshape from Fig. , suggesting that the high-pH component is a mix of LE and CT states. This picture is consistent with the presented explanation of electronic effects (node HOMO level affected by pH) in competition with Coulombic effects (diminished positive charge on the node core promoting hole transfer). The presence of solvent electrolyte was also found to have an effect; the CT state may be stabilized at a higher pH by compensating the missing protons with alkali metal cations (see Fig. ).

  "As starting points of the entire workflow, the quality of fragments collection would determine the final output to some extent. Although fragments from co-crystal structures or based on hypothesis can be used as proprietary input whenever available, it would inevitably be limited by the real fragment collection around the size of 10 3 or human bias. To ensure the diversity of the starting fragment library, we proposed an algorithm that can potentially enumerate all possible molecules containing up to 12 heavy atoms with MW ranging from 50 to 210. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to systemically explore such fragment chemical space.",

  "representative, yet the protein structure loses stability over time at extreme pH values, making it difficult to improve the pK a predictions. SNase has several challenging residues to predict and a less representative crystal structure, despite the Null model's excellent performance. Altogether, these are quite challenging systems and the RMSE values obtained with our AMBER 14SB implementation align well with those reported in the literature using different methods and force fields. In terms of computational efficiency, AMBER 14SB simulations were faster than the ones using CHARMM 36m, likely due to the smaller long-range electrostatics cutoff employed in AMBER. However, GROMOS 54A7 simulations remained the fastest overall, owing to the united-atom nature of this force field. Across all GPU-accelerated simulations, the PB/MC step becomes the most computationally expensive. Hence, to increase the method's performance, particularly for larger systems (with many titrable residues), efforts should prioritize accelerating the protonation state predictions.",

Along with recycling stream, fresh WW enters the primary settling tank, where in 97% of it flows to the aeration tank, while the remaining ends up as a sludge (Figure ). Biological treatment happens in the activated sludge tank, where in most of the C and N was converted to sludge. Sludge corresponds to 6%, which enters the thickener, while the remaining 94% of mass moves to the secondary settling tank. In secondary settling tank, solids removal efficiency is assumed as 30%.",
  "Other than the operando XRD/XANES data, which give us access to average electronic and structural information on the samples at the top of charge and after 1 cycle, we have measured also ex situ EXAFS for the undoped NM and the lithiated sample LNM-2, to verify by a bulk probe if locally around the Ni and Mn cations any sign of irreversible degradation following the O redox upon charge could be detected. The fittings of ex situ EXAFS are included in the Figures and. The fitted parameters are included in the Tables and. During charge the Ni-O bond lengths, as well as the in-plane Ni-Mn interatomic distance, are drastically changed in NM. On the other hand, these distances are almost constant in LNM-2, indicating much reduced structural variations. These results show that Li-containing samples display less significant structural change upon charge, proving that lithium's presence can mitigate structural instability even when probed locally in the first and second coordination shell around Ni.",

Flat catalyst particle surfaces had the lowest deformation, and the portion of the topography images in Figure that showed tip imaging (flat slopping surface between catalyst particles at height ~0 µm to ~1 µm) had mid-range deformation. Presumably the mid-range and high deformation is from the side of the pyramid-shaped AFM probe contacting a catalyst particle edge and sliding along it until the PF tapping setpoint was reached, causing a larger vertical travel distance between the initial probe-sample contact and reaching PF tapping setpoint force.",

The values calculated for ε r are not 'true' dielectric constants for a real material in that surface charge and edge effects are not taken into account as the material simulated is periodic and the value is a volume average. Dielectric constants in real materials are volume and %loading dependent, so for increased accuracy %loading ratios of inclusions to matrix were kept between 3-5% while still allowing sufficient matrix to separate periodic images of the mNP. Here, the %loading is reported in numbers of atoms, as the volume occupied by an inclusion atom is, on average, the same as the volume occupied by individual matrix ions (as shown in our previous work 1 ).

  "Mathematically, the parameters b = 0.503 and Δ max = 0.712 are equivalent to the Langmuir constants, and  = 2.203 is a stretching factor that originally considers energetic inhomogeneities on absorbing surfaces. In our application equation 11 directly correlates modulation depth to the number of occupied ligand binding sites of each HSA molecule. However, these spin counting strategies are intrinsically restricted and are only applicable in the range of about 0 < NL < 4 equivalents of 16-DSA due to the saturation-like behavior in the corresponding lnPAB(r) and modulation depth (Δ) curves (Figure and). Thus, in combination with double integration in CW EPR, equations 9 and 11 allow for spin counting in an empirical fashion, without accounting for multispin contributions stemming from more than two dipolar-coupled spins in the relevant distance range, which we have studied in HSA before. To check for the proposed ligand redistribution processes above 64 °C53 we chose a rather unconventional strategy, so we will demonstrate its feasibility in the following. Aliquots from a single 16-DSA-probed HSA stock solution were incubated for 5 min at a respective temperature between 9 °C and 81 °C. If cooling proceeds in equilibrium with the environment, all ensembles should be identical and should reflect the ensemble at the glass-transition temperature. Hence, we chose shock-freezing from the respective temperature directly, a non-equilibrium process. Such, we achieve freezing in a spin ensemble that might ) and linear chains.

  "We can now fully specify the DFTB Hamiltonian developed herein. Harmonic confinement potentials (i.e., with p = 2) are used throughout. Hamiltonian matrix elements are computed via density superposition, using separate confinement potentials with r 0 w for the basis functions and r 0 d for the atomic densities. Together with the atomic size σ Z A for the repulsive potential, we thus need to fit three parameters per element, all of which have the unit of a lengthscale. All matrix elements, as well as the on-site energies ν and the Hubbard U parameters of each element were calculated with the Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional as implemented in Libxc and Hotcent . DFTB calculations were performed with DFTB+. [50] Reference data was computed at the PBE level, using FHI-aims with tight basis and integration settings. Following the approach of Heine and coworkers, the parameters are fitted on reference data for real and fictitious homoelemental crystals. This allows defining a consistent set of training structures for all elements in the periodic table. Specifically, we use six prototypical structures (Dimer, Graphite, Diamond, β-Sn, BCC, and FCC), covering a wide range of coordination numbers for each element (see Fig. ). All configurations are initially optimized to their optimal volumes at the PBE level and then uniformly scaled from 80% to 120%. This process generates a series of equations of state curves that serve as reference data.",

  "Overall, this section demonstrates the benefits of our p-DOS descriptor for predicting ultrafast time-resolved X-ray signals. Such ultrafast X-ray experiments are becoming increasingly common , meaning that computations to e ciently and accurately support analysis are also increasingly desireable. To perform computations with su cient sophistication for the description of ultrafast processes requires a large number of often time-consuming quantum chemistry calculations. When applying our DNNs appropriately as pocket-oracles, the opportunity is presented to both theoretical and experimental colleagues to indicate avenues of investigation which will glean meaningful results with extremely rapid turnarounds. Hence the intelligent application of ML democratises data analysis and enables end users to plan and better utilise their experimental beamtime allocations by facilitating on-the-fly real-time analysis for XAS.",
  "However, the decrease in intensity in the low binding energy region might also arise from formation of a layer containing weakly adsorbed species which attenuates the signal originating from the underlying crystalline O 2-.

Kang et al. developed ALMOMD (Active-Learning Machine-Operated Molecular Dynamics ), a Python workflow package interfacing FHI-aims with the MLIP codes NequIP and so3krates . ALMOMD is designed to effectively train MLIP through a SAL scheme with an automated framework that samples unfamiliar data, e.g., rare events, based on the uncertainty estimates of MLIP predictions (Figure ). While MLIPs hold great promise, many material problems are high-dimensional in nature and involve costly evaluation of an objective function. This can benefit from SAL workflows that dramatically reduce sampling, such as those involving Bayesian optimization. This algorithm builds probabilistic Ndimensional surrogate models for materials energy or property landscapes, then refines them with smart sampling. The strategic acquisition strategy of blending data exploitation with design space ex- ploration ensures fast identification of optimal solutions. Such a probabilistic algorithm is encoded into the Bayesian Optimization Structure Search (BOSS) Python tool for materials optimization and made interoperable with FHI-aims and ASE.",
  "The present work seeks to understand the remarkable accuracy of water cluster binding energies predicted by the SCAN and r 2 SCAN meta-GGAs evaluated non-self-consistently on the Hartree-Fock (HF) density. To do this, we use approximate measures of functional-driven errors (FEs) and density-driven errors (DEs) used earlier in ref 7 to study the same errors in reaction barrier heights. For the water dimer, ref 14 demonstrated that approximate FEs and DEs in its binding energy computed with the 50% global hybrid of r 2 SCAN (r 2 SCAN50)",

Bior oligo-arylation as well as germinal arylation (e. g. 1,1-diphenylethylene) of olefins was also detected as side reaction, but only below 5% ratio relative of the expected mono-coupled product. Although the efficiency of the catalysis drops in the presence of air (Table ), hydroxyl groups do not decrease the reaction's progress (entries 5, 6). Sterically hindered substrates (entries 4, 7, 8 in Table ) are harder to convert to coupled products. This aligns with the kinetic observations regarding the sterically bulkier thus less effective ligand iPr BICAAC mes at complex 6d.",

The earlier dissociation of 1-Me is not in contradiction with their results because the pressure at which the thermochemistry was calculated was with 1.73•10 -4 bar lower in our study and therefore the equilibrium is shifted towards the monomer. With this, both studies give the same qualitative predictions for the given range of temperatures.",
  "It is common to include unbound solvent molecules and counterions in experimentally obtained MOF structures. These neutral solvents often need to be removed for a computationready database. However, the charge distribution will be significantly adjusted if mistakenly deleting counter ions or charged solvent molecules without additional annotation in subsequent calculations. Researchers typically assume such structures to be neutral, leading to an adjusted charge distribution to compensate for the unbalanced charges, which can drastically affect the accuracy of the calculation results.",
  "The crystallographic coordinates for 1 0 were obtained from the structure deposited at the Cambridge Structure Database with Refcode NUDDIC, which corresponds to Re2(µ-dppm)(S2CNEt2)4. All calculations present in this paper were performed using Orca 5.0 package, otherwise mentioned. The BP86 functional were used in this work. SARC-ZORA-TZVP basis set to describe the Re ions, and def2-SVP basis set to describe S, P, N, C, and H in combination with SARC/J auxiliary basis set. The atomdispersion correction with the Becke-Johnson damping scheme (D3BJ) were applied. The resolution of the identity (RI) approximation was employed for fitting the Coulomb integrals. The TIGHTSCF keyword were used for all geometry optimization. Single point gas-phase CASSCF calculations was carried out using def2-TZVP basis set to describe the Re and def2-svp/c 29 to describe S, P, N, C, and H with def2/J auxiliary basis set of Weigend. To speed up the CASSCF calculations we have used RIJCOSX approximation. The natural bond orbitals (NBO) were calculated using Gaussian 16 package.",
  "Multi-component molecular liquids present additional challenges to ML modelling because they feature an increased diversity of local molecular environments. We demonstrate that a potential intended to model a target molecular composition must still be trained on all compositions. Extending the data in this way, ensures all local molecular environments are uniformly represented in the training set.",
  "Continuum charging stabilizes the implicit solvent interface slightly and the stabilization increases at lower potential / higher amount of electrons. Still, the charging stabilization is close to the 0 eV assumed in approaches that take the electrostatics of the interface into account, but do not account for interface charging, e.g. the capacitor model and field effects. Studies relying on continuum charging and implicit solvent could therefore give the erroneous impression that charging is unimportant for electrochemistry.",

  "Ligand structures were processed with antechamber and parmchk2 from Amber18 62 to generate Ambercompatible .mol2 files containing AM1-BCC charges and GAFF2.11 atom types. Proteins were parameterized with the ff14SB force field using tleap. Protein -ligand complexes were solvated with TIP3P water 66 in a truncated octahedral box with a wall distance of 13 Å from the outermost atoms; NaCl 67 was added to neutralize the system net charge and reach a concentration of 150 mmol. The structures were then subjected to 50,000 steps of energy minimization with restraints of 3 kcal*mol -1 *Å -2 on protein heavy atoms, followed by constant volume heating to 300 K over a period of 1 ns; a density equilibration phase of 1 ns, followed by 5 ns of equilibration at constant pressure and temperature (NPT conditions), maintained with the Berendsen barostat and the Langevin thermostat, and a production phase of 25 ns of NPT simulation. Collision frequencies and pressure relaxation times were set as in previous work. As before, a cutoff of 12 Å was used for both van der Waals and electrostatic interactions; long-range electrostatics beyond the real-space cutoff were calculated with the particle-mesh Ewald (PME) scheme, and bonds to hydrogen were constrained with SHAKE, allowing for a 2 fs time step. All systems were simulated with heating, density equilibration, preproduction dynamics, and production dynamics under periodic boundary conditions; only the minimization stage was run under nonperiodic conditions. During production dynamics, frames were saved every 100 ps for a total of 250 frames per trajectory.",
  "The stretched out, hydrophilic pMeOx blocks were subjected to an energy minimization and a short, 50 ps long simulation with the Noisé-Poincaré-Andersen method (applying the Amber14:EHT force field with the R-field implicit solvation model ) to yield a more compact starting conformation, while keeping the inner strand in a straight orientation. Figure depicts the prepared structure. All modeling was performed with MOE (Molecular Operating Environment 2019.01). The setup was inspired by previous modeling studies regarding worm-like micelles of small molecules, in which the generation of a continuous micelle was also achieved via initial placement of hydrophobic parts in the inner and hydrophilic moieties in the outer regions of the threadlike structure, which was aligned along one axis of the simulation box. RESP partial charges of single monomers used as building blocks were derived from calculations with Gaussian 09 Rev. C.01 (Hartree-Fock level of theory, 6-31G* basis set); parameters based on the Amber14ffSB 29 and GAFF2 force fields were assigned via antechamber and parmchk2 of AmberTools18. During charge derivation monomer structures were capped with residues of the same type (except for the terminal groups, Me-MeOx and EIP, which were capped with a MeOx monomer). The calculated parameters were used to generate a polymer with an initial straight conformation using tleap. Subsequent solvation of the starting structure with TIP3P water in a simulation box with a minimum border-to-polymer distance of 20 Å in the X and Y directions resulted in a system size of approximately 16 x 18 x 10 nm 3 with 76,730 solvent molecules. Water molecules found inside the inner hydrophobic strand after this initial placement were removed if the distance to the pPheOzi blocks was less than 10 Å. Periodic boundary conditions with minimum image convention were applied during the simulation, which allowed for an infinitely sized worm-like micelle along the Z axis and ensured a sufficient distance between polymers of neighboring boxes along the X and Y dimensions. The simulation was performed using NAMD 2.13 with 2 fs time steps. An initial energy minimization of 10,000 steps was conducted before slowly heating the system from 100 K to 278 K over the course of 500 ps. Harmonic constraints were initially applied on all polymers and gradually reduced over an additional 1.6 ns, allowing a rapid reordering of solvent molecules around the polymers. Langevin dynamics and the Nosé-Hoover Langevin piston method (1 atm) were used for temperature and pressure control in an NPT ensemble.",
  "Results indicate that, as with the GDB-13 models, the DNC model performs at the same level or slightly better than the RNN model (Table ). Both models perform ostensibly better than the baseline in most metrics but without any significant difference between them. For instance, the Fréchet ChemNet Distance , a measure that compares how bioactive molecules from the training and generated sets are, is at least half that of the previously best model (VAE). There are two exceptions: validity and scaffold similarity score to the TestSF set.",
  "Carrier density in the model systems was controlled by modulating the total charge. Consequently, all computations were executed with unrestricted spin due to some model scenarios having an odd number of electrons. The estimation of partial charges was carried out using Löwdin population analysis. All atomic schematics depicted in Figures 3, 5, 7, and 9 were generated using the XcrySDen program .",
  "Additionally, the higher yields seen for 11 and 1 as compared to their undecorated analogues (9 and 10, respectively) indicate that the remote steric bulk described by cone angle is beneficial for catalysis, potentially through mediating ligand dissociation dynamics or stabilizing catalytic intermediates. Overall, these observations reinforce that %Vbur (min) is the dominant feature controlling ligation state and the favorability of ligand dissociation.",
  "Akin to how the catenane motor shown in Figure is coupled to the fuel-to-waste turnover, the FTC ----ETC + C reaction couples to our coarse-grained motor model. Briefly, we choose interparticle potentials (see SI Section 2.1 for details) so that black particles form a stable circular track around which moves a shuttling ring built from green particles. That green ring feels an attraction to two different orange particles, modeling binding sites, located on opposing sides of the black track. Finally, two catalytic units are placed next to the binding sites, mimicking the structural asymmetry of the original experimental design. Similarly to the experimental catenane motor, kinetic asymmetry emerges in our simulation due to the steric hindrance of the green ring shielding the proximal catalytic site from FTC species.",
  "To describe the first two excited-states of Lut we used multireference semiempirical QM/MM calculations, with Lut as the QM part and the environment (i.e., all residues within 30 Å of Lut) treated as a fixed MM part described using the force field parameters detailed above. More specifically, we employed the AM1 Hamiltonian explicitly reparametrized for",

It was hypothesised that (FmFMN1) produces two distinct polyketides, a tetra-and a pentaketide, with changing numbers of double bonds dependent on the selective activities of the trans-acting ER FmFmn2, as only one PKS is expressed inside the FMN BGC (Figure ). showed no activity towards Penicillium italicum with MIC value > 900.0 μM.

  "The experimental data corroborates that while propagating surface plasmons may be sustained, resonance features are absent in both Ti 3 C 2 T x and Ti 3 C 2 Cl 2 MXenes in the measured spectral window of 0.73-3.34 eV, as these waves are strongly attenuated due to the strong dielectric loss.",
  "We applied LEGOLAS to a simulation of the Figure shows that at any frame of this simulation, the amide proton on residue 5 of 2CYU could have a chemical shift as low as 7 ppm and as high as 9 ppm. This variation emphasizes the potentially significant fluctuations in chemical shifts across backbone atoms under constant volume and temperature (NVT) conditions, therefore underscoring the importance of considering a protein's complete structural dynamics when predicting chemical shifts.",
  "The ChRs during the eld campaign served to simulate an additional, unintentional emission with a known release rate to the baseline operational emissions from the site. Most of the operational emission sources at these sites were continuous: compressor exhaust and packing seals, unburnt methane from catadyne heaters on meter runs and reboilers for combination units (dehydration and separation). Only a few intermittent sources were present (gas operated pneumatics, and in some cases maintenance work caused short blowdowns or vents). ChR rates were originally chosen based on typical fugitive component emission rates (0-2 kg/h) and discussions with the operator; However, after no detections were clearly identiable in data from installed PSN systems during initial releases, the planned release rates were modied to include higher emission rates in an attempt to improve the learnings from the study. (Figure ). Across all host sites 165 ChRs were performed in total. All releases were conducted during weekday operations (M-F) between 8AM and 5PM with the supervision/participation of operator personnel. Duration ranged from 10 to 240 minutes (average 68 minutes) with rates between 0.2 and 24.1 kg/h (average 5.2 kg/h). The portable release rig was setup to a eld tap, a release location was decided with the operator, and the emission point was temporarily installed at the selected location.",
  "Romanov and Bockman, and Stefan showed that (carbene)2Cu + and 𝐶𝑢 , where X = halide, alkoxide, thiolate and alkynyl, can show emission from MLCT excited states, with emission lifetimes in the tens of s range in the solid state, but give characteristically low PL in fluid solution. These complexes are relatively straightforward to prepare. The deprotonated carbene reacts with a metal salt to give the (carbene)M(halide) complex, and the halide is replaced by an exchange reaction with a metal nucleophile, Equation . The same procedure is used to prepare alkoxide, thiolate and amide complexes.",
  "for Li + in a 21 m LiTFSI WiS electrolyte . Notably, the infrequent presence of free water molecules (see Fig. ) supports this mechanism by disrupting the hydrogen bonding within the water-rich domain, effectively decoupling Na + transport from the solvent cages. This distinctive transport mechanism leads to a superionic regime , where ions move faster than predicted by Walden's rule based on the electrolyte viscosity 116 . Consequently, the WiS electrolyte demonstrates acceptable ion transport properties for battery applications (see Sec.4.2), despite the expected highly viscous nature of the solution at significantly high salt concentrations associated with the WiS regime.",
  "To gain more insight into motional effects of the quadrupolar interaction, deconvolutions of the NMR spectra were performed using the dmfit software package. The spinning sideband manifold is captured by the broad component, attributed to the satellite transitions. The line widths of the central and satellite peaks from the spectral fittings and the extracted values of the quadrupolar coupling constant Qcc are summarized in Figures S12 and S13 over the measured temperature range.",
  "After metal precursor (CoCp2) pulse, the higher energy Co (100) surface is terminated with Co atoms at a coverage of 3.33 Co/nm 2 . From our previous study We then performed calculations for reactions of trench N species and H radicals. The results show that trench N species can react with H radicals to form NH, with a computed reaction energy of 0.24eV for the 1 st NH formation. However, there are no further reactions to form intermediate NH2",
  "Next we investigate vacancy trapping by considering the temperature dependent MC acceptance rates for vacancy migration in the different alloys (Fig. ). The data sampling is initiated after 4000 MC vacancy migration attempts. We note that in pure metals the \"vacancy migration\" approach would always find ΔEDFT = 0 eV and accept all MC attempts. Furthermore, we have observed that kinetically trapped \"vacancy migration\" simulations often end up in a situation, where the vacancy swaps between two adjacent lattice sites with similar energies, but never moves any further. We therefore choose only to count attempts, where the vacancy does not move back to its previews position in the next accepted move. In the 200 K AgPdPtIr \"vacancy migration\" simulation, the vacancy and three Ag atoms swaps between four lattice sites, which still registers as a high acceptance rate, even though it does not change the overall structure.",
  "The obtained Au NPs are readily relevant to study size effects in catalysis, for example for the 4-NP reduction. The smaller NPs lead to the more active catalysts for the 4-NP reduction. The NP obtained by the proposed method are more active than NPs obtained using for instance harmful chemicals such as NaBH4.",
  "Crambin. The initial structure was obtained from PDB ID: 2FD7 , with mutated residues reverted to the wild-type sequence. The system was solvated with 8205 explicit water molecules. Simulations were performed for 1 ns at 300 K, excluding the first 500 ps for equilibration. The root mean square deviation of Crambin, RMSD(t, t+∆t), was obtained excluding hydrogen atoms from two 1 ns runs. Power spectra were computed from atomic velocities sampled over a 125 ps trajectory with a time resolution of 2.5 fs using schnetpack package .",
  "The activation barrier of 110 kJꞏmol -1 found for the MC ring closure in the melt state was significantly lower than that of mono-and non-functionalized SPs (p-MIX and p-CE), suggesting an additive effect of covalent incorporation of SPs in linear polymers. Vitrification, however, further decreased Ea to 47 kJꞏmol -1 , indicating that the chain center in PMMA is subject to much larger forces in absolute terms in both melt and glassy states.",
  "In summary, each pure solvent studied possesses unique advantages and disadvantages as an NR carrier solvent for a wide range of MPs. Hex, despite being the most non-polar solvent, falls short in yielding the strongest FI and induces adverse swelling in some plastics. Chl exhibits the strongest FI for all MPs but causes complete deformation in plastics with styrene groups (PS and ABS) and PVC. Alcohols (Met and Eth) show limited degradation but poor fluorescence across most polymers. Although not as bright as Chl and with some dissolution of the polymer structure, Ac has been proven to induce fluorescence in all nine MPs studied. Furthermore, the extended color spectrum of Ac makes it more suitable for clearly distinguishing between plastics.",
  "The single-crystal X-ray diffraction method confirmed the solid-state structures of Int A' and IntA2' (Figure ). Colorless crystals of Int A' and Int A2' were grown in toluene/ ether at 5 o C and crystallized in triclinic (and monoclinic) with P1 ̅ and P21 space groups (crystal and structure refinement data in ESI, Table ). In both structures, the central aluminum atom adopts distorted-tetrahedral geometry bonded with an N, N'-chelated monoanionic Dipp CBGligand, one hydrogen atom, and one amido fragment (-NCHN or -NCHS).

As per literature analysis, our current structurally characterized Int A2' is the only example of a single hydroalumination product with isothiocyanate fragment (-NCHS). 29",
  "Thus, bimetallic nanozyme containing very low amount of silver (Ag1Cu35@CALB hybrid) caused a huge reductase-like activity enhancement (up to almost 400 times) compared to the original copper hybrid. Moreover, if we compare these results with the data obtained for a CALB hybrid with only Ag in its composition, a clear improvement can be also observed. Hybrid Time",
  "From the perspective of the photoelectron, a point dipole should be a reasonable representation at large distances. However, calculation of the photoelectron matrix element integrals (especially for low eKE and lower angular momentum components) involve integrands with significant contributions near the origin, precisely where the point dipole approximation is least appropriate.",
  "While irradiation of tetrahydroquinoline in the presence of photoredox catalysts and cobaloxime typically yields quinolines, addition of strong acid, such as TsOH or TfOH, gives the unsymmetric product of their coupling (Figure ). Mechanistic studies suggest i) fast equilibrium between the tautomers 20, 21 and 22 and ii) the reaction proceeds via enamine-iminium coupling. Extending the reaction results in loss of five H2 molecules in total and therefore aromatization of the coupling product. [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 and Co(dmgH)2(p-CO2MePy)Br enable dehydrogenation of nitrogen-containing heterocycles, such as tetrahydroquinolines and indolines. The released H2 was utilized to hydrogenate styrene derivatives over Pd on carbon.",
  "It was already shown in Junk et al. that HSA exhibits much smaller modulation depths for a 16-DSA loading ratio of 2:1 than derived from model biradicals, despite a similar number of coupled spins should be present. Therefore, standard spin counting procedures that utilize standardized inversion efficiencies λ do not apply properly for this self-assembled system. Another study also emphasizes the effect that cooperativity may have on modulation depth. Furthermore, the potential number of accessible binding sites in this study (here: N T = 8.1 ± 0.3, see Table ) gives rise to tremendous multispin effects that leads to overestimation of short distances and suppression of large distances. First, the previous experiments from Junk et al. are reproduced with the 16-DSA-probed HSA system (here in equivalents of cH = 0.18 mM).",
  "Electronic spectral and numerical evidence shows that the BOLS-NEP notion regulates the bond and electronic performance of the undercoordinated atomic catalyst and that the HBCP principle governs the molecular physisorption and the subsequent catalytic activation of reactant molecules by forming the atomic dipolar-or vacancy-substituted M P /V 0 :R-Y hydrogen bond. The BOLS-NEP notion indicates that atomic undercoordination shortens and strengthens bonds between undercoordinated catalytic atoms. Bond contraction densifies electrons accommodated in the core bands and bonding orbitals; bond strengthening deepens the local potential that entraps the densified bonding and core electrons. The densely entrapped electrons, in turn, polarize the even less coordinated edge atoms, making them protruding dipoles, as displayed by Ag adatoms on Ag(111) , Cu adatoms on Cu(111) surface , atomic vacancy and defects on graphite (0001) surface , Pt and Rh adatoms .",
  "Graphene is an excellent charge conductor, meaning an impedance mismatch for electromagnetic waves at the interface between this material and air, mismatch which means wave reflection. A possible strategy to obtain microwave absorption capability in graphene is to \"lower the conductivity of graphene and make it magnetic simultaneously\" . To have \"magnetic graphene\", possible methods are based on zigzag edges, vacancies, adatoms or heteratoms (see please references in Quan et al.). Chemical doping is keeping the graphene structurally stable, but at the same time introduces the point defects: among dopants, \"N atom is considered as an ideal candidate in that it has equivalent atomic size with carbon atom\" . Quan and coworkers are considering just graphene to pursue the impedance match to have microwave absorption. Let us stress that Quan and coworkers are producing experimental data about magnetization and reflection loss of the material.",
  "The reasons of target proteins selection are as follows: ACE2 and CD147 are the main receptors of the virus ; Host cell protease Cathepsin L/B is the key element of the lysosomal pathway , and almost all of them are in lysosomes. 3C-like Proteinase is main proteases of novel coronavirus . PLpro is necessary for the virus to process polyproteins as mature subunits. Guanine-N7-methyltransferase, NSP1/2/7/8/10 were involved in RNA transcription and replication . NFκB1 and HMGB1 are important lung inflammatory regulators , Anneixn A2, HnRNP A2/B1 were proved as transcription regulators associated with pneumonia .

Bonds between consecutive beads in each arm are modeled via a finitely extensible non-linear elastic (FENE) potential,",
  "To probe the coupling reactions further, possible mechanisms were considered. The non-radical coupling route to form 8 likely occurs by a CMD (concerted metalation-deprotonation) step ( 3). This type of mechanism had been explored in depth, notably by Fagnou et al. although using different bases. One characteristic observed in those studies was that, when the arene partner was deuterated, this led to substantial primary kinetic isotope effect for the removal of the H/D in Ar-H/D. Although our reactions use a different base, KOtBu, the deprotonation of a benzene molecule would still likely be a challenging step. Specifically, the product of oxidative addition, 15, could progress through intermediate 16 to 17. The loss of a proton from benzene in the conversion of 16",

  "Quantum-chemical calculations were performed in ORCA 6.0.0 package. The analysis of computational results was performed using the Multiwfn 3.8(dev) package. Geometry optimization was performed using the range-separated CAM-B3LYP functional with relativistic full-electron basis sets (ZORA-def2-TZVP for light elements and SARC-ZORA-TZVP for Pt) within relativistic ZORA approximation. Solvation model based on density (SMD) was applied with parameters for methanol.",
  "For these materials, adsorbate networks can expand via primary and secondary interactions to form hydrogen bonded multimolecular chains. These hydrogen bonded chains could continue to grow off the main chains through side association which is represented by the side association affinity parameter Kas. This can only occur in systems that have geometric allowance to accommodate such growth at high relative pressure . Consistent with the Guggenheim-Anderson-de Boer (GAB) analysis of Andersen , the parameter Kas represents the fraction of primary and secondary sites that allow subsequent layering. Under strict conditions of homogeneous monolayer (K0=K1) and a complete multilayer (Kas =1), the BET isotherm is obtained as shown in Table .",
  "• Overall system energies (2): van der Waals (vdW) and GB solvation terms The inclusion of these features is inspired by previous research. The GB solvation energy, interaction energies and SASA terms are reminiscent of the molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) method. The template-based terms are inspired from the IFD-MD work. The contact-based terms resemble those from the random-forest scoring function (RF-score) implementation. However, the score for each of the contact terms is determined using a distance-based function found in ChemScore, similar to that implemented in Protein-Ligand Empirical Interaction Components (PLEIC), instead of a numerical count per element pairs to allow for normalization (see next subsection). We note that more advanced features could be incorporated, such as the number of potential bridging water molecules and excess chemical potential from molecular quasichemical theory, provided they increase model performance and can be calculated in reasonable time for large number of individual snapshots.",
  "The kinetics difference shown in Figure is caused only by the E/Z TS gap increasing from 2.9 to 3.5 kcal mol -1 gap, moving us away from the experimental result. This small change in relative energies is the same magnitude as could be caused by conformational changes. However, for a system where the high conformational flexibility is located outside the strict reactive space, NEB methods should still converge to optimal MEPs, as long as they are provided with reasonable end points -the reactant and product in a relaxed geometry. When the relaxed geometry must surpass a conformational barrier to react, the NEB can be restarted from the more accessible conformation(s). If this barrier is easily surpassed thermally, the overall activation energy is still defined relative to the most populated, lowest energy conformer.",
  "In conclusion, we demonstrated the preparation of dual-cured polymers via the combination oxa-Michael and anionic polymerization. The polymerization tendency increases with increasing Lewis (or Brønsted) basicity of the initiator and with increasing electron-deficiency of the vinyl groups of the monomer. For acrylates highly active catalysts such as P2-tBu or the electron rich phosphine TTMPP must be employed whereas for DVS also less active catalysts such as DBU or DMAP can be used.",
  "In the previous chapter, we also discussed the ansatz of Skulason et al. to change the electrode potential by adding or removing hydrogen atoms in the water layer.

  "Indications for an oxa-Michael reaction with ethanol as well as double bond migration could be retrieved. Two multiplets peaking at 3.72 and 3.56 ppm assigned to the diastereotopic methylene group of an ethyl ether derivative are representative for the oxa-Michael derived byproduct 2b, present in approx. 30%. The assignment is based on a model compound derived from methyl crotonate, which was saponified using the same protocol as used for 1 (Fig. ).",
  "Acyclic tricarbonyl substrates were also competent, though their cyclized products were prone to retro-Claisen reactions, leading to inconsistent yields. Cyclopentanone 2u was formed in 68% and 30% yields under the two conditions, likely due to various levels of decomposition during workup. The symmetrical substrate 1v gave the lactone product 2v in good yield under both conditions along with a mixture deacetylated product 2s. Attaching the alkene tether at the reactive α-carbon of the dicarbonyl gives methyl cyclopentane product 2w under the cerium-free conditions, albeit in low isolated yield due to product volatility. This product is commonly formed through reductive photoredox methods that require pre-functionalization of the malonate starting materials to install a carbon-halogen bond. Cerium-containing conditions gave 2w in only trace amounts.",
  "Additionally, compounds CO1206 and EA47 displayed one unfavorable donor-donor hydrogen bond with Arg271, while compound NA1411 formed a similar interaction with Gln263. Notably, Favipiravir was the only compound to initiate an attractive charge electrostatic interaction with Ile329, likely due to its tri-phosphate group, indicating a unique recognition pattern. The diversity of interactions observed with key residues involved in dsRNA binding and IFN antagonism supports the identification of Favipiravir as a promising Marv VP35 inhibitor. Elsewhere, compounds CO1641 and NA3805 each formed an amide-pi stacked interaction with Pro222, though they likely follow different binding mechanisms. Similarly, compounds CO921, CO1206, EA636, and CO2039 established pi-pi Tshaped interactions with Phe228, despite differing inhibition mechanisms. However, shared interactions with key residues suggest similarities in their binding process (see Figure ).",

  "For the same two reasons mentioned above, the pathlength becomes also more broadly distributed the higher the beam aperture used, a feature reflected in a faster decay of the interference fringes with the wavenumber and in the increased broadness of the peak in the |FT| of the absorption spectrum (Fig. ).",

  "ABSTRACT: A simple protocol is outlined herein for rapid access to enantiopure unnatural amino acids from trivial glutamate and aspartate precursors. The method relies on Ag/Ni-electrocatalytic decarboxylative coupling and can be rapidly conducted in parallel (24 reactions at a time) to ascertain coupling viability followed by scale-up for the generation of useful quantities of UAAs for exploratory studies.",
  "Fragments were selected to allow coupling to a diazirine linker containing an alkyne and also an acid or amine handle as appropriate. The fragments were coupled to diazirine linker via an amide coupling reaction (Figure ). Initial in-house investigation of the chemistry showed that purification to >95% purity is readily achievable using simple silica column purification or mass directed LCMS preparative purification. The products are stable during work up and purification and when stored cold and in the dark (a refrigerator). Coupling was be carried out using standard amide bond forming reagents that are easily separated from the product FFFs. In addition to preparation of the FFF probes (with the functionalised linker), we also prepared analogous non-photoreactive short chain aliphatic amides (\"capped products\") (Figure ). These will be required as control compounds for hit validation experiments. The compounds have a higher average heavy atom count than some commercial libraries such as the Enamine Fully Functionalized probe library. The intention is to increase the probable library hit rate by lowering the required binding affinity of each atom required to obtain reasonably potent hits. Other parameters are in typical relevant ranges.",
  "A custom-built multipin system was used to measure the I-V responses over -2 V to 2 V using a Keithley source meter (2604B, dual-channel, 40V SMU). A minimum of three batches obtained from different spinning solutions and at least four samples from each batch, i.e., on average 12 samples were considered for each condition.",
  "To comprehensively illustrate the results of FAIVE, we used AptaCluster to cluster all the obtained sequences and selected the seed sequences of the top 95 clusters to validate their binding to RBD and their ability to disrupt the RBD-ACE2 interaction. The binding abilities of the selected aptamers were assessed under harsher reaction conditions, revealing that most sequences exhibited higher fluorescence intensity than the initial library (Figure ).",

  "All long MD simulations were performed using GROMACS 2021.5, both with the modified and the default AMBER ff14SB force fields, and the TIP3P water model. We simulated triplicates of 1 µs each, with a 2 fs integration step, of systems that underwent a two-step minimization procedure and were initialized as described Section 2.3. The nonbonded interactions were treated with a single cutoff of 1.0 nm, updating the neighbor list every 20 steps. Beyond the cutoff, all van der Waals interactions were truncated, and the Coulombic interactions were treated with the Particle-Mesh Ewald (PME) method 63 using a Verlet scheme cutoff of 1.0 nm and a Fourier grid spacing of 0.125 nm. The LINCS and SETTLE 82 algorithms were used to constrain bond length between H and heavy atoms of solute and water molecules, respectively.",
  "The absorption spectrum around the oxygen K-edge that we obtain agrees qualitatively well with the experiments. The calculated oxygen K-edge main absorption peak is at 543 eV, which differs by 7 eV from the experimental value. The theory level that we consider is hence adequate for describing the fundamental physics of the re-DFG processes that we address.",
  "Varying inter-and intra monomer perturbation orders yields a variety of levels of many-body SAPT. In defining the levels of SAPT, we following convention by relabeling polarization and exchange terms using their corresponding interaction energy type. The four main interaction types are electrostatics, exchange-repulsion, induction, and dispersion, though higher perturbation orders will lead to increasingly complicated cross terms combining two or more of these four types.",
  "Compound selection for cofactor pocket After a comprehensive evaluation of the scores, we selected compounds with a chemgauss4 score lower than -5, a binding affinity score of -15 or lower from the docking step, and a score of 40 or higher from the unaligned pharmacophore score calculation step. The cut-offs were chosen to obtain a manageable number of 20 -100 compounds for downstream analysis. In this work, we got 25 compounds after filtering for those scores (Table ).",
  "Since metals in group IIIA have higher charges than those in group IIA, the oxygen atoms bonded to group IIIA metals display a lower ϵ value. Therefore, when a significant change in the local chemical environment with different polarizability occurs, we provide a workflow to refit parameters. Even if only a few atoms change their environment, the refined FF may still work.",

  "In conclusion, we have adapted the TD-FGR approach for bimolecular reactions, and the suc-cess of this method with all three thiothymines, while MT-FGR fails for 4tThy and dtThy, demonstrates the generality of this approach. More importantly, this study finds that a method to calculate photosensitization rate constants, must necessarily describe the inherent quantum effects that drive the process.",
  "The strength of hydrogels dropped dramatically upon swelling due to the dilution of solid matter, leading to reduced performance and structural destruction . Positive swelling can also induce residue stress in the material, causing buckling, wrinkles and other morphological deformations . Without altering the intrinsic trend of swelling, those drawbacks will not be effectively addressed.",
  "The stabilization is a huge effect and highlights the limitations of QM/MM simulations with only electrostatic embedding. Usually QM/MM simulations only include the polarization of the QM (chromophore) region by the surrounding static charge distribution. However, for CT states, the opposite effect, where the environment gets polarized and screens the Coulomb interaction between electron and hole, is equally important. Our QM/MM-IEDRF calculations put the lowest CT states below the optically bright state of the special pair.",
  "Markovic and coworkers showed that in a series of La1-xSrxCoO3 compounds, surface reconstruction to amorphous CoOOH was observed following Sr dissolution and oxygen-vacancy formation measured with on-line inductively-coupled-plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) and identicallocation transmission electron microscopy (IL-TEM) analyses. They further showed that this amorphous Co phase was activated by trace Fe impurities in the electrolyte, forming dynamically stable active sites .",
  "The tested mPB models vary from simple homogeneous jellium models and neutralizing Gaussian background charges to common point-like PB and to mPB models with specific ion contributions including the ion size and dielectric decrement effects. All the included mPB approaces are based on the linear dielectric SCMVD 59 model of the liquid. Calculations for the interfacial electrostatic potential distributions show that the jellium model screens less than other mPB models while the mPB apart from ionic decrement produce almost identical electrostatic potentials. The ionic decrement model screens the charge rather slowly but introduces slight asymmetry between positive and negative potentials. The long-range behavior of the ESM -like boundary condition method differs significantly from the mPB models.",
  "Particularly, the higher crystalline degree would enhance the piezo-catalytic performance of our synthesized materials. The results suggest that both crystal planes will critically influence the catalytic process by balancing the movement of excited holes and electrons in vertical and horizontal directions, which can help avoid charge recombination to efficiently reach the surfaces from the bulk structures to drive redox reactions.",
  "The global optimization protocol presented herein follows a similar philosophy as the GAP-driven random structure search (RSS) proposed by Deringer, Pickard and Csányi in two aspects. First, it requires no assumptions about the adsorbate geometry or site a priori. Secondly, the global structure search Global Optimization Workflow and GAP fitting are performed simultaneously, since a pool of candidate structures is iteratively generated by MH and used to select new training samples.",
  "where Γ was previously defined in Eq. ( ) and B w (x α ′ , p α ′ ;t) corresponds to the Wigner transform of operator B associated with bead α ′ evaluated at time t. The sum ∑ α̸ =α ′ indicates that only cross-bead terms are taken into account when evaluating the correlation function; this behavior arises due to the necessity of projecting each set of mapping variables associated with each bead into the appropriate SEO space, as detailed in Appendix A. The initial path-integral nuclear distribution takes the usual form,",
  "DFT simulations were performed with the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP; version 5.4.4) and the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional. Dispersion effects were incorporated by using DFT-D2 method with our reparametrization of the C6 coefficients for metals. Core electrons were treated with the Projector Augmented Wave (PAW) method and valence electrons expanded with plane waves up to a basis set cutoff of 450 eV. Electronic convergence was set to 1•10 -5 eV and atomic positions were converged until residual forces fell below 0.003 eV•Å -1 . Spin polarization was considered. Dipole corrections were applied due to the asymmetry of the different slab models. The studied surfaces were Ni(111), the most abundant on Ni nanoparticles, (211), and (110), where different supercells were simulated. Following previous computational studies, the supercells for Ni(111) were p(2• √ 3x2• √ 3)-R30º, and other derivatives such as",
  "The COMPAS-1D dataset of the COMPAS Project, was used. The dataset contains the density functional theory calculated structures and properties of ∼9K cata-condensed PBHs comprising 1-10 rings. In the current study, we focused on two molecular properties: the HOMO-LUMO gap (HLG) and the relative energy (E rel ). E rel was defined as the difference in energy between each molecule and its respective lowest-energy isomer, where 'energy' refers to the total energy calculated at the optimized geometry using the B3LYP/def2-svp combination with Grimme's D3 dispersion scheme 34 and Becke-Johnson damping, without zeropoint correction. To probe the role of dispersion, we also used E SCF rel -which is defined similarly, but does not include the dispersion correction (SCF stands for self-consistent field).",
  "Preceding or concurrent works demonstrate the feasibility of ML models trained to preserve molecular similarity: presents a distance aware transformer trained on ZINC database, (MolCLaSS) employs a graph neural network contrastive learning procedure to obtain embeddings whose tanimoto kernel correlates with ROCS Shape and Color similarities and BIOPTIC scales the inference and vector index architecture for large scale molecular search on chemical spaces such as Enamine REAL. Despite these advances, sound theoretical expositions and engineering breakthroughs, results on standard virtual screening benchmarks remain to be shown and in terms of accuracy and practicality the gap between traditional and the new methods is yet to be bridged. CHEESE aims to bridge this gap by training a model to induce a vector space based on 3D shape and electrostatic similarity metrics derived from the overlap integral of volume or electrostatic charges on best-aligned conformers from an ensemble. It achieves state-of-the-art results in industry-standard virtual screening benchmarks, including LIT-PCBA, DUD-E, and Sidechain Virtual Screening, competing effectively with leading 2D and 3D methods as well as molecular docking. CHEESE demonstrates up to three orders of magnitude speedup over existing methods, utilizing O( √ n) time complexity rather than O(n) by leveraging advancements in approximate nearest neighbors (ANN) and implementing a custom vector database along with algorithms for clustering, indexing, and searching large vector spaces with limited RAM and CPU resources. Additionally, CHEESE achieves a threefold improvement in the enrichment factor during multi-ligand evaluations compared to single-ligand assessments, highlighting its effectiveness in optimizing sets of candidates in real-world scenarios. Thanks to its vector space, advanced set-to-set similarity (or batch search) techniques can be adapted to leverage the information of multiple active and inactive compounds. Novel approaches for doing so inspired by point cloud registration and optimal transport literature are introduced. Lastly, it significantly reduces the cost of 3D shape and electrostatic virtual screening from >$50 per query to <$0.0005 per query on cloud infrastructure, making it a practical option for researchers.",

As virtual screening continues to evolve, CHEESE's balance of computational efficiency and performance demonstrates its potential utility in drug discovery, offering a novel and scalable approach to ligand-based screening.",
  "Finally, we confirmed that the ATRA reactions proceed with the same efficiency under visible light irradiation. Thereby, the reaction between diethyl bromomalonate and substrates 2 and 3 in AcCN/H2O, 3:1 mixture, and using catalyst 1b and 470 nm excitation light source led to the products 12 and 13 with 98% and 99% yields respectively (Table , SI). In this case a BODIPY unit was selectively excited at λex=470 nm to produce S1 [BODIPY]*. The remaining steps of the mechanism are analogous to the described above for 350 nm excitation.",
  "As judged through QM/MM analysis with large (> 200-atom) QM regions, the BesD protein environment stabilizes Lys the most (ca. 51 kcal/mol) through a number of HBs, followed by moderate stabilization (ca. 21 kcal/mol) of Thr by SyrB2 and limited stabilization (7 kcal/mol) of 12-epi-fischerindole U by WelO5. This quantitative comparison indicated that the stabilization provided by the protein environment in halogenases is correlated to the charge and polarity of their distinct substrates more than whether the enzyme requires a carrier protein.",
  "The role of an RFB membrane is to suppress the crossover of redox reactants to the wrong side of the battery, which results in capacity and coulombic efficiency loss, while providing high conductivity of charge carrying ions to minimize the cell resistance and provide high voltage efficiency and areal power density. Because crossover species and charge carrying ions must each take transport paths through the hydrated membrane pores, efforts toward decreasing membrane resistance tend to concomitantly increase crossover. For most flow batteries that comprise negolytes and posolytes with different chemicals (vanadium RFBs being a notable exception because they comprise vanadium in four different oxidation states), crossover leads to capacity loss that cannot be recovered without a burdensome chemical purification process, and it is particularly important for crossover to be reduced to nearly negligible rates.",
  "Among the screened conditions, operating the flow reactor at reduced residence times appeared to yield high-quality FrCOF-1 at a high STY of 49,471 kg m -3 day -1 (Fig. ). This suggests that shorter residence times within the flow reactor might facilitate the production of highly crystalline and well stacked FrCOF-1.",

This mechanism could contribute to maintaining the excited states alive for longer times and the UOP observed.

  "To reproduce and predict er values for the Scheme 1 reaction, we began by rapidly generating 50 conformers for each of the four possible orientations of the styrene substrate with the catalyst (Figure ) using Molassembler. This process was done individually for each of the 12 mannitol-Cp/R-group derivates given in Scheme 1c (1A-4C). Owing to the speed and flexibility of Molassembler, this process could be completed in under 1 minture per catalyst/R-group combination. Structures were subsequently refined at the GFN2-xTB level in implicit ethanol solvent using the ALPB formalism and Gaussian16 to drive the transition state optimization. Converged TS structures were then further optimized at the B3PW91 -D3(BJ) /def2-SVP level followed by single point computations at the B3PW91-D3(BJ)/def-TZVP level with the SMD implicit solvation model (ethanol). Finally, the solvent-corrected free energies were group by selectivity (R and S) and Boltzmann weighted at 296.15K.",
  "We did not simply 'get lucky' or stumble across a similar waveform randomly, as the convergence plot (Fig. ) shows that for each optimization string (S2-S4), the waveform optimized for serotonin test set accuracy (W2) found a new minimum for serotonin prediction error during each iteration. This improvement across strings suggests that the surrogate model is learning a reasonable representation of the optimization landscape for serotonin accuracy. Convergence plots for all metrics and runs are provided (Fig. ).",

The number of identical molecules among top 100 compounds bound to the hinge region was the lowest for radius 1 and 2 (0-14%). For larger radiuses the number of identical compounds was substantially increased to 27-83% (Figure ). Therefore, repetitive runs may be less reasonable for generations with radius 3 and greater.",
  "(MBRAUN® Unilab Pro SP). To create the full cells, lithium foils were punched (10 mm diameter), scraped to remove oxide, pressed onto the LLZO pellet, and placed into customized Swagelok® cells. The side of the LLZO pellet opposite the Au was gently polished with 2000 grit sandpaper inside the glovebox prior to cell assembly to re-clean the interface before the adhesion of a scraped lithium foil to act as the cell anode. Porous stainless-steel discs (McMaster-Carr) were used as current collectors on both sides of the pellet stack. These stacks were placed within PEEK cells, clamped in a vice to apply stack pressure, and rapidly connected to the MS for electrochemical testing.

  "Nevertheless, looking at the products in thermodynamic equilibrium can be a first step to elucidate probable SEI components, in particular as longish AIMD simulations such as done in Ref. are not applicable to a broad range of electrolytes and different Li concentrations.

  "The CO-stretching modes of IrLHRh were examined via FTIR-spectroscopy from which a TEP 83 (Tolmann electronic parameter) of 2045 cm -1 was determined. Contrary to the observation of IrLH being a) a stronger base (hydrolysis under ambient conditions) and b) a stronger nucleophile (reaction with MeCN and DCM) compared to classical MIIs (like Mes L 79 , Figure ), the obtained TEP suggests that IrLH is a slightly weaker net-electron donor as Mes L. As the TEP-value combines effects of donating and accepting properties which influence the TEPvalue in a contrary fashion, the observed reactivity of IrLH might be the result of higher π-accepting contributions in IrLH.",

  "A duplicated 3/8-inch copper sample tube was leak-tested, attached to the gas handling manifold, evacuated, and then pressurized with 898 Torr of the He or D 2 calibration gas mixture. After 1.5 hours, the pressure remained constant confirming that the 3/8-inch tube was leak-free when pressurized. The investigations show that both manifolds using saddle valves and cold-welded copper pinched tubing were hermetic and can be used with confidence for the transfer of lowmass gas samples.",

To calculate transport properties, the Siesta and TranSiesta packages were utilized. For electrode and scattering region calculations in TranSIESTA we used 1×1×100 k-points, respectively, and a cutoff value of 400 eV.

  "These distinctive advantages of the circular economy process allow to address the point raised by Olsen and coworkers for whom it would be unlikely that fish processing by-products can be used \"to any large extent to produce high-priced products\". [14] The life cycle assessment of the process in the scaled-up configuration in which the laboratory scale solvent recovery step using a rotovapor is replaced by industrial distillation clearly points to its environmental sustainability. Being easily adopted at fish processing plants or at new sites located near (30 km away) the fish factory, the process addresses the two main difficulties in implementing bioeconomy productions based on circular industrial chemistry applied to fish biowaste, namely physical proximity and process efficiency. [38] Using a health beneficial natural solvent under ultramild conditions (between 4 °C and room temperature under atmospheric pressure) to convert animal biowaste into two highly valued bioproducts and generating no waste, the process indeed meets the green extraction principles of reduction in energy consumption by low energy input demand, reduction of unit operations, and safe and easily controlled process conditions.",

The revised Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (RPBE) functional within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was used as the exchange-correlation functional due to its improved performance in describing adsorption energies on surfaces. The kinetic energy cuto↵ for plane waves was restricted to 520 eV. Integrations over the Brillouin zone were performed using Monkhorst-Pack k-point meshes with a uniform density of 64 k-points/ Å 3 .

  "We have presented a data driven procedure for the optimization of computational resources usage for both ABFE and RBFE calculations with thermodynamic integration. Our RBFE scheme affords up to 85% computational resource reduction when compared to the CDK2 benchmark system results published by Song et al, while maintaining average MAE of approximately 1 kcal/mol. Our protocols have successfully approximated long-run simulations of small RBFE mutations performed on the PLpro system, with the larger Ligand 4 mutation deviating more significantly but still within 1 kcal/mol on average. Our ABFE schemes yield fast one-off calculations with similar accuracy when compared to a base case of uniform and constant resource allocation on the T4 Lysozyme L99A/M102Q mutant in complex with N-phenylglycinonitrile, and several implementations become more accurate while maintaining computational efficiency as batch size increases.

  "The present simulations highlight the critical role of nonsymmetric molecular vibrations in facilitating the nonradiative decay of photoexcited heptazine compounds. Our findings suggest that, in the gas phase, internal conversion is a major recombination channel, despite the thermal stability of the heptazine molecule. Intersystem crossing, not taken into account in our theoeretical model, is also a relevant relaxation process that is enhanced by vibronic effects. Substitution of NH 2 groups on the HTZ molecule to form melem decreases the excitedstate lifetime of the latter due to the destabilizing effect of the amino groups, which promotes the formation of conical intersections with the ground state. This behavior is consistent with analogous aromatic amino compounds that exhibit lifetimes within the ps timescale range.",

  "To maximize insights regarding the activity of sub-nano clusters it is important that the electrocatalysts be atomically monodisperse, and theory must follow the ensemble of dynamically coupled isomers, rather than focusing on just a static global minimum structure. For example, Sun et al. reported that the most stable isomer of Cu4O3 was inactive for alkane oxidative dehydrogenation, however, barrierless isomerization to metastable isomers with low barrier facilitated its catalytic activity . Pt13 can populate low-energy metastable structures under hydrogen pressure, which play a major role in its catalytic reactivity . Pure and alloyed Pt clusters supported on Al2O3 were also extensively studied theoretically and experimentally , showing that at temperatures typical for catalysis, the cluster geometry changes frequently.

  "Figure shows a comparison of the thermodynamic mixing properties obtained from MD simulations at T = 400 K with theoretical predictions employing ∆ HB = -10.5 kJ mol -1 and α == 2.05. We would like to point out that the behavior obtained at the highest temperature of 400 K is representative for the entire investigated temperature range, but is offering the best statistics. Obviously, the model is describing the simulation data very well using the energy difference ∆ HB obtained independently from the van 't Hoff analysis discussed in Figure . In addition, as shown in Figure , the corresponding fractions of HBs to both anion species are described similarly well.

  "ab inito molecular dynamics (AIMD). The stability of interfaces in the training set was simulated with AIMD using the density functional theory (DFT) Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) within the projector augmented wave (PAW) formalism . For the exchange-correlational functional, we employ the mixed scheme of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) , including the rotationally invariant Hubbard (+U) correction for transition metal compounds based on the PYMATGEN RelaxSet for DFT ionic relaxations from the Materials Project . All calculations used a 500-eV energy cutoff, with a Gaussian smearing with a width of 0.05 eV and a 1x1x1 Gamma-centered K grid to improve run time and computational cost, though note that with the large computational cells (∼8x8x40 Å) the gamma point will likely be enough for convergence. An NVT ensemble with a Nose-Hoover thermostat is used to model the time evolution of the interfaces, as implemented in VASP, set to maintain a temperature of 550 K. Atomic evolution in these simulations occurs in time-steps of 2 fs and run for 40-60 ps. Structure relaxation calculations were similarly done on materials from the ICSD, using a convergence criterion of a maximum force on each ion of 0.02 eV/ Å and a self-consistent field convergence of 0.001 eV in energy difference between electronic steps. These results were used to compute their E f orm and ∆E rxn feature values. A 550 K simulation temperature is used to speed up reaction kinetics. Li (T M = 453.5 K) is liquid at this temperature, but we assume reactivity with liquid Li at 550 K is an overestimate on the reactivity of Li metal an room temperature. Since we wish to develop a reactivity classifier that can find stable materials, an overestimate on the reactivity allows for a stricter criteria for stability and added confidence on the stability predictions. For SSEs that melted during our 550 K simulations, 400 K simulations were performed instead.",

This adsorbed Pb brought properties to this PAni/Pb composite that are very attractive and may be of interest in preventing hydrogen evolution in LAB. The high HER onset potential over -0.75 V vs Ag/AgCl is the most significant for this aim, but there are other considerable consequences. The Raman spectroscopy shows that the Pb adsorption keeps the emeraldine salt stable in a potential window in which leucoemeraldine should be predominant. This behavior is considerable because the polarons and bipolarons responsible for PAni conductivity are present even in the potential window typical of the LAB.",

Using the FEP/MBAR approach was not only computationally more expensive than the OSP approach discussed above, but also lead to ligand wandering-off and convergence issues. The non-interacting pose wandered-off upon turning the restraints fully off (Figure and S8). This led to poor phase space overlap between the penultimate window and the last window (Figure ) and caused convergence issues for MBAR (Figure ). Comparatively, in the OSP approach the @luctuations in the energies on going from the reference state to both endpoints in the backward and forward direction were not large, and the free energies converged well.

It can easily be automatically installed and executed on Windows using batch files. Detailed instructions on installation and functionality are provided in the SI. Input MS raw data can be converted vendor-independently from data-dependent acquisition (ddMS 2 ) files into the mzML data format (.mzML) by using the MSConvert software from ProteoWizard . Only mzML files with centroided spectra and one collision energy (CE) should be used.

  "Here, we introduce the Biosynfoni fingerprint (from BIOSYNFOrmatic fiNger-prInt), which uses 39 structural features aligned with the biosynthetic nature of compounds, moving beyond purely structural characteristics. We achieve this through a substructure key-based fingerprint using building blocks and patterns described in Dewick's 2009 book on natural product biosynthetic logic (Figure ,A25) . This selection of building blocks and detection principles helps our fingerprint, Biosynfoni, explicitly cover biosynthetically relevant structural features. We show that in comparison to other widely-used fingerprints, Biosynfoni better reflects biosynthetic distance, defined as the number of enzymatic steps separating two compounds in an enzymatic pathway, and performs on par in natural product-specific applications while providing enhanced explainability.",

  "This contribution presents easyPARM; an automated, streamlined, and reliable tool to generate (non-transferable) force field parameters for metal-containing molecules based on the unique labeling strategy of all atoms that complex the metal center. By generating as many atom types as necessary, the parameterization procedure based on the Seminario method provides reliable descriptions of the molecular structural dynamics of a wide range of metals and coordination spheres at a very small computational cost. The program only requires the Cartesian Hessian matrix computed with the Gaussian 09 or 16 software, the geometry file (standard Cartesian coordinates xyz format), and the RESP charges computed also with Gaussian. Force field parameters are then returned in ready-to-use Amber format files. The versatility and accuracy of easyPARM has been extensively benchmarked for a variety of metal complexes against density functional theory simulations both in the gas phase and solution, exhibiting an overall excellent agreement between both descriptions. Atomic charges on metal centers (or any other atoms) can be finely tuned through the restrained electrostatic potential method implemented in easyPARM.",

DFT optimization was performed with the CAM-B3LYP functional and the def2-SVP 68 basis set, using Grimme's D3 dispersion correction with Becke-Johnson damping, as implemented in Orca 5.0.3 and 5.0.4. The resolution-of-identity and the chain-of-spheres approximations (RIJCOSX) were invoked for the Coulomb and exchange integrals, respectively. The AuxJ keyword was used to call the required auxiliary basis sets. Harmonic vibrational frequencies were calculated at the same level of theory to confirm that all geometries were minima on their respective potential energy surfaces. For each molecule, the respective cation and anion were optimized at the same level of theory including subsequent frequency calculations, as well.",

To account for electron beam effects, the third term incorporates the generation value (G-value) Gi of i and the density of water (𝜌 = 1 g/L). Gi is nonzero if i is a primary product or H2O (see Supporting Table for details). This zero-dimensional simulation models a perfectly mixed solution.

  "The major species of 10 consists of a single ligand environment, and not the characteristic doubling of ligand environments on self-assembly we have previously observed for cis CCNN metal-peptidic cages. Whilst inverting the 4R-Hyp stereocenters of 8 enabled the formation of a single isomer, it was not the expected cis CCNN isomer. The absence of desymmetrization on cage assembly indicates formation of either an 'All Up' CCCC or trans CNCN arrangement as the major isomer (see SI Section 9). We attribute the minor species observed in the 1 H NMR to small amounts of the remaining 3 isomers, and subpopulations of cages containing cis amide bonds, as no other major species were observed by ESI-HRMS (Figure ). Geometric considerations, and molecular modelling, suggest the formation of the trans CNCN isomer would be unfavorable (see SI Section 10 for computational modelling), without extensive loss of PPII folding, which is not observed by CD (Figure ), and analysis of the NOESY correlations further supports this assignment.",

Finally, we used ZORA DFT calculations to compute the 195 Pt CS tensor parameters of the molecular and supported Pt-species studied. The differences in CSA parameters can be related to differences in the coordination environments using simple and powerful orbital models. Modern computational chemistry packages allow accurate prediction of NMR properties, including 195 Pt chemical shifts, which is useful for structure determination by NMR crystallography protocols. As demonstrated earlier by Ziegler, the origin of the 195 Pt CSA can be traced back to electronic structure. Autschbach subsequently demonstrated a localized molecular orbital analysis of Pt CS tensors that provides a clear link between the energy and symmetry of orbitals in square planar Pt compounds and the observed CS tensor parameters: the deshielding for the CS component along the z direction of the molecular frame (denoted dz), originate from the coupling of the high-lying, filled dxy orbital with the antibonding σ *(Pt-L) orbital by the L ̂z operator and, to a minor extent, from the filled dxz and dyz Pt orbitals coupling with the specific σ *(Pt-L) along the y or x axis, by L ̂y and L ̂x respectively (Figure , details in experimental section below).",

The first Brillouin zone was sampled at the Γ point, only. The structure optimisations used a plane-wave energy cutoff of 600 Ry and triplezeta Gaussian basis sets included in the CP2K distribution (TZVP-MOLOPT-GTH for H, O, P, TZVP-MOLOPT-SR-GTH for Al).

  "The verification and (partially manual) identification process of prioritized features from the PFΔScreen results table (Excel) was performed by sorting the table according to decreasing intensity, after removing features based on defined MD/C-m/C cutoffs. For soil M1, this resulted in a feature list with 305 potential compounds. Note that some features appear multiple times in the list due to structural isomerism, resulting in multiple features at multiple distinct RTs depending on the degree of separation and the peak finding algorithm. Each feature was verified manually for occurrence in the extraction blank and reasonable peak shape (until <1% of the most abundant feature). Although a blank correction was performed, typical contaminations from the LC system with long tailing peaks can be integrated multiple times at different RTs. Therefore, they are not always correctly removed depending on the specified parameters. By using the RawDataVisualization tool of PFΔScreen, EICs of every m/z belonging to one HS (using the integrated HS extrapolator) can be verified for RT-shift and peak shape, eventually resulting in identification of homologues with very low abundances that were missed in the feature finding process due to the MS intensity threshold. The chemical formulas from suspect hits were used to check for reasonable isotope patterns with the RawDataVisualization of PFΔScreen. SMILES codes were used to verify at least one candidate per HS by an MS 2 spectrum.",

  "A reasonably good accuracy of the new OPT BIND5D radii set in predicting hydration energies of small molecules is another indication of its low over-fitting, as well as of the possibility that this set may generalize well outside of the Train set of molecules. The values of the radii in our two new binding radii sets and the OPT SOLV set have to be considered as effective parameters. One clear trend that emerges is that the radii sets optimized for binding are distinctly different from optimized against HFEs of small molecules -the regions of the 5D parameter space where these families of optimal solutions are found are substantially separated. The basic underlying reason is the inadequacy of physical approximation in the relatively simple (but effective) implicit solvent models used in this work.",

  "The highest yields were observed when using the smaller, bullet-style blender at moderate speeds (≈ 10 krpm), where most of the power is dissipated into the fluid (2% mass yield of 5 layer average graphene after 30 minutes on, using the Kenwood with a water/NaC dispersant). This yield and production rate is favourable compared to existing and more expensive laboratory methods (e.g., ultrasonication). Separation and characterisation of the material after processing is explained in more detail within Section 6.",
  "In conclusion, our study shows that the linker matching approach can be used to influence the local structure in a ternary COF system. We have developed a mathematical model that estimates possible mixing behavior based on linker size compatibility. The finding in TEM images of solid-solutions, heteroepitaxy, and local structures of idealized mixed phases, validated the model. As no larger, new crystalline phases were detectable, and the reflexes overlap in the PXRD of hcb and sql COFs. This makes it difficult to systematically optimize the synthesis conditions, as performing TEM measurements for every sample would be too time-consuming. Achieving stoichiometric mixed phases remains challenging without further methods to quantify the individual phases to reach the pure mixed phases.",
  "The sensitivity of the EBSD using FM550 electrode was evaluated for end-point electrochemical HRCA and compared with those obtained from real-time PCR instrument-based fluorescence endpoint readout. For endpoint HRCA, the primer carrying the DENV sequence was varied between 2 fM to 20 pM with 100 M of MB as the redox probe concentration. Percentage change in peak current is computed with respect to NTC and the signal for all DNA concentrations of EBSD (Figure ) was compared with relative end-fluorescence with respect to NTC (Figure ).",
  "The performance of Noise2Void has been shown to decrease as the noise increases . MSI images are, however often corrupted by very high levels of noise, rendering the denoising less effective. One way to overcome this limitation is to focus instead on the scores images obtained from PCA decomposition. Indeed, they capture the variance in the dataset by definition and hence display lower levels of noise than individual ion images. The denoising of score images for example currently being explored in the remote sensing community .",
  "We use the Minnesota solvation database an extensive grid search for tuning hyperparameters: learning algorithms, learning rates, and dimensions of hidden layers. We select the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm with Nesterov momentum, whose learning rate is 0.0002 and momentum is 0.9. Optimized hidden dimensions are 150 for recurrent layers and 2000 for the fully connected layer. To minimize the variance of the test run, we take averages for all results over 9 independent random CV, split from different random states. . The BiLSTM and the BiGRU models show no significant differences, while it makes relatively inaccurate predictions without recurrent networks. All results are averaged over 9 independent test runs and black lines on tops of boxes denote variances.",
  "In a straightforward statistical-mechanics model, incorporating an accurate local anharmonic correction for vibrational motion is challenging due to the inherent difficulty in precisely mapping out the basin surrounding a local minimum using only basic knowledge about the sampled stationary points (minima and saddle points). In practice, such mapping is achievable for the simplest classical systems through direct phase-space sampling, provided the computational cost is reasonable, and sufficient ergodicity is attained.",
  "Second, while DockQ is a useful metric for evaluating protein-protein interface accuracy, it has known limitations, particularly for PROTAC-induced complexes with twisted or highly flexible interfaces. DockQ assumes a rigid-body superposition model, which may not adequately capture alternative conformations or induced-fit effects that are critical for ternary complex formation. As PROTAC-mediated interactions often involve dynamic binding events, low DockQ scores may reflect alternative binding poses or slightly misaligned interfaces rather than outright prediction failures. A more nuanced approach incorporating ensemble-based evaluation metrics or energy-based scoring functions could provide deeper insight into ternary complex stability and binding cooperativity.",

Measurements were taken with a step size of 0.020°, employing dwell times ranging from 5 to 15 seconds and a 1 mm collimating slit.

  "So far, studies conducted on similar cell configurations have primarily focused on attempting to improve SEI formation and reversible Li plating/stripping . However, cell design and testing parameters used vary widely, making comparison difficult. Thus, a detailed investigation of robust \"benchmark\" ZELiS cells is warranted to enable rational modifications and achieve the goals of minimising inactive material content (e.g., conductive additives and binders), low electrolyte volumes and high sulfur loading. Furthermore, the lack of excess Li and rapid capacity fade make it an attractive platform to quickly evaluate the efficacy of cell modifications.",
  "The parameters chosen both for generative modelling and retrosynthesis let both models run for a longer time, 1000 epochs compared to 100 during generation and 5 minutes instead of 2 for retrosynthesis evaluation, than previous uses of the same architectures . This yields more output building blocks and solves more routes than previous use in demonstrated studies, and potentially include LibINVENT output that could be a result of over-exploiting the QSAR model. This was done intentionally to increase the size of the search space and provide a larger diversity of building blocks with respect to quality properties to showcase the effect of the different strategies.",
  "Across our 276 complexes, the metal Mulliken and natural bond orbital (NBO) 66 partial charges of these complexes vary widely and are, at times, negatively valued (Supporting Information Figures ). Given the high-valent nature of the metal center, large negative values of both charge schemes are surprising and could be sensitive to the choice of basis set and population scheme . We thus also compared to the metal partial charge obtained with real space partitioning (i.e., Hirshfeld charges 67 which instead are always positive and in a much narrower range (from 0.0 to 0.7 e, Supporting Information Figure ). Despite differences in quantitative values, the qualitative trends for all three partial charge schemes follow expectations based on differences in terminal chalcogen electronegativities (i.e., O>S>Se), with terminal-oxo complexes having more positive metal partial charges than terminal-sulfido or terminal-selenido complexes. When two terminal chalcogen atom types are present, the effect on partial charge is additive, with values in between the limits of the complexes with two identical chalcogen atoms.",
  "SAL workflows using MLIPs such as Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP) and, more recently, MACE have been designed based on training data generated by FHI-aims. Examples of this include workflows for crystal structure prediction , battery materials or surface catalysis . In these applications, it proved essential to have large flexibility with respect to simulation types (including global optimization, transition state searches, molecular dynamics and enhanced sampling methods) and training set selection (e.g., via uncertainty estimation or farthest point heuristics). These requirements have led to the development of the wfl package, a Python toolkit for interatomic potential creation and atomistic simulation workflows that emphasizes modularity and parallelisation over sets of atomic configurations .",

Figure shows that heat treatment effectively removes Li 2 CO 3 and some LiOH, leading to a higher proportion of LLZO being revealed compared to the polished surface. The presence of LiOH is attributed to Li + /H + exchange inside the glovebox after heat treatment and is consistent with the NAP-XPS results, which show recontamination post-heat treatment. SEM of HT LLZO (Figure ) indicates that heat treatment maintains the surface morphology but exposes more surface asperities (e.g., pits) compared to the Gb:Pol surface.",
  "This descriptor was first introduced in our prior study of mutation effects in lactonase SsoPox, where a piecewise linear correlation was observed between the activation free energies and SPI values for various lactonase mutant-substrate pairs.

The corresponding equilibrium volumes are obtained from a Birch-Murnaghan equation-of-state fit, performed using the atomic simulation environment (ASE). This reveals that PBE/min+s overestimates the equilibrium volume V 0 of silicon by 6%, compared to PBE/tight. Beyond this, the BSIE also impacts the shape of the energy volume curve. This discrepancy in shape and equilibrium volume between two energy-volume curves can be assessed with the ∆-value introduced by Lejaeghere et al.:",

  "Crystallising 5 revealed its unusual double-triangular architecture and confirmed the desired cis-diastereochemistry (Figure ). Following Maligres' study on the very high reactivity of Nsaziridines , we reasoned that a single equivalent of chalcogenide would react regioselectively at the nosyl aziridine. Indeed, 5 min treatment with KSeCN gave 6 as the sole product (Figure ). Addition of Na2S in one pot gave the monocyclic 1,2-thiaselenane 7 cleanly after 10 min, by a rapid double nucleophilic substitution: first displacing cyanide from the Se centre, then intramolecularly opening the Bus-aziridine (this order of attack is supported since reaction of isolated 6 with a monothiol gave the selenenyl sulfide exclusively; Figure ). Finally, reacting 1,2-bis-sulfonamide 7 with VTT triflate gave the SeSP (bicyclic cis-piperazine-fused 1,2-thiaselenane) 8 as a key precursor to the target cis TrxR probes, with an X-ray structure confirming the regioselectivity of chalcogen introduction (Se proximal to the Ns-amine). The trans diastereomer control 7T was synthesised similarly, but in higher yield due to a more efficient diamination (Figure ). Overall, this scalable sequence gave the densely functionalised, redox active cis and trans SeSP motifs in 5 steps, with ~30% overall yield, and only three chromatographic purifications (Figure ).",

  "We filtered compounds with molecular weight greater than 400 Da from CHEMBL301 which consists of CDK2 bioassay results with IC50 values. Compounds in CHEMBL301 with bioassay descriptions explicitly reporting to be tested on CDK2/Cyclins are removed because they bind to a different protein conformation caused by cyclin activation. The above filtering rules result in a 147-compound virtual screening library for the CDK2.

  "The introduction of absolute energy for training the ML correction model contributes to a more stable optimization and leads to robust models with consistently more accurate predictions of both chemical energies and electron density compared to the parent functional. With the modest semilocal correction of the XC energy density, improved and more balanced performance of DFAs for chemical predictions with SCF calculations can be safely achieved without significantly degrading the compliance with strict physical conditions. The ML-B3LYP built in this work is an enhanced B3LYP functional and can be a favorable replacement for both types of B3LYP functionals commonly used in electronic structure calculations. The computational efficiency of the SCF convergence for the original DFA is effectively preserved by the ML-DFA.",

  "The most noticeable aspect of explicit charging is the free energy contribution from charging the interface with cations and electrons (∆G charging ). This has two consequences, the first is that electrochemical reactions are directly dependent on the electrostatic potential via the e (pot) and ⁻ M + (aq) reference species. This is why explicit charging in some sense is an extension of CHE.",
  "On the other hand, atomic volumes also depend on the valence widths s (Eq. ( )).

  "Given that photo-CIDNP polarization typically builds up and decays relatively fast (< 1 s) and in situ, the pulse sequences employed in photo-CIDNP typically include time delays, optical/UV illumination and radiofrequency (RF) irradiation within the same single-transient train of events. 1D 1 H photo-CIDNP pulse sequences can be as simple as pulseacquire preceded by laser or LED optical irradiation, and may include RF pulse schemes for solvent suppression. In addition, 1 H, C or N presaturation may be performed before optical (visible or UV) irradiation to eliminate thermal polarization, so that the resulting spectrum reflects solely photo-CIDNP hyperpolarization. Even better thermal polarization background suppression is achieved upon combining presaturation with appropriate 180° flip-angle pulses and delays, forcing the recovered/residual thermal polarization after presaturation to oscillate about zero net contribution without undergoing any significant recovery.",
  "3. Satin : Satin tear is quite similar to that of the Sergé, but the number of chain sons and wet threads which pass on each other before Sentrecroiser is higher. Each satin fabric is characterized by a number, usually 4 or 8, indicating that the chain wires pass over 4 or 8 wires. The result is a fabric with one side that contains more chain threads and another side of more sons. Satin tear is well suited to molding complex shapes.",
  "Density functional theory (DFT)-based calculations using the B3LYP functional were performed to look for systematic trends in how annelation influences (i) the relative energies of cis/trans diastereoisomers; (ii) dichalcogenide ring tension, revealed by SS/SeSe distance and dihedral angles (Table ); (iii) the energy cost of dichalcogenide reduction (Fig ). We compared energy minima of oxidised and reduced SS66C/T and SeSe66C/T while varying groups in the annelating ring (-CH2-, -NH-, -NMe-, -NAc-, or -N(CO2Me)-; see Table ). We were pleased that the piperazine's second nitrogen did not destabilize the bicyclic dichalcogenides. Unsurprisingly, reductions of disulfides were easier than of diselenides (Fig S4 ); but other trends were small, with no clear differences of reduction thermodynamics compared to previous piperidine SS66 systems (Tables",

  "Generative models for de novo design offer an alternative to virtual screening or HTS, by instead generating focused selections with a smaller size . Several deep learning models have been proposed to generate chemical libraries in a focused manner, in particular decorating a scaffold by suggesting which building blocks to attach to this scaffold. The Mol-GPT model showed capability to both optimize a lead, as well as decorate a scaffold . STRIFE emphasized pharmacophore information to decorate and optimize proteins . Domenico et al. adapted the REINVENT 3 architecture to create focused libraries towards inhibiting NA, AChE and SARS-CoV-2 . LibINVENT 41 uses reinforcement learning to generate reactionconstrained decorations to input scaffolds. These methods can generate building blocks for combinatorial library design, but do not inherently offer an optimized combinatorial selection. Given a limited experimental budget, there is motivation to develop workflows for optimizing combinatorial design for novel de novo generated building blocks.",
  "The 3d Löwdin charges of this cobalt atom decrease over the oxidation process leading to the formation of acetone, while those of Co 4+ bonded to OH groups and Co 3+ bonded to acetone and H 2 O molecules increase and converge to to the same point.

  "Evaluation of the secondary structure prediction and identification of representative 3D structure begins with the MMB output structure.

We exclude the first 2 nanoseconds of each trajectory as equilibration and present in Figure the normalized free energy surfaces for each of the reaction coordinates identified in Figure . The temperature was 310K, pH 7.4 and ionic strength 163 mM. Relevant MMB and Tinker control files are provided the GitHub repository. Following RC 1, we can see that there is no ring-closing; the bases of the loop do not pair to form a hairpin. From RC2 and additional visual scrutiny, we can see that the hairpin from bases 10-25 is very stable throughout every free aptamer trajectory. Finally, in RC3 we see at least two minima, one with the bases 9 and 35 paired, and one very wide basin where they have detached.",

  "The crystal structure of JUK-8(NO2)cp was refined from powder X-ray diffraction data, collected in transmission geometry at 195 K using home-built dedicated instrumentation, based on Empyrean-2 powder X-ray diffractometer (ω-2θ goniometer, alpha1 system) using a customized sample stage, based on ARS DE-102 closed cycle helium cryostat (T = 30-300 ± 0.1 K) and adsorption cell, built of 1.33′′ CF-flange and Beryllium dome. After ab initio indexing of PXRD using XCELL software, the unit cell, similar to earlier reported JUK-8(Br)cp was obtained. Further, the structural model, based on JUK-8(Br)cp was created using visualization module of Materials Studio 5.0 software (Accelrys). The obtained model was subjected to Rietveld refinement considering Zn atoms, phenyl rings, NO2, CH=N and CO-NH groups as rigid bodies, which resulted in 14 rigid fragments with 78 degrees of freedom (rotation and translation).

  "Using the developed approach, we computed the SBFE of GYKI to AMPAR for two ligand poses: a crystal pose, which is observed in the AMPAR-GYKI crystal structure and a flipped pose, which was obtained by docking in our previous work. Our long MD simulations demonstrated that the GYKI crystal pose is stable in all subunits while the GYKI docked pose shifted significantly with respect to the initial pose and stabilized only after a significant time (up to 600 ns depending on a subunit).

  "We present a rigorous means of validating vHTS pipelines and estimating recall, enrichment, score, and ranking variation at every step. Herein, we report an alternative method to data set generation that does not require any additional experimental work and expenditure, yet offers negative data sets that are far larger and far more appropriate in benchmarking and validation studies. For ABFE studies, it offers the ultimate benchmark -N disparate protein -ligand pairs serving as the positive set, to be correctly ranked and selected out of N! -N potential decoy pairs, where N is already on the order of hundreds, thousands, even tens of thousands, depending on what subset of PDBbind one chooses to utilize. Such data sets make astronomical numbers look minute in comparison. Additionally, for every protein -ligand structure in PDBbind or the RCSB PDB, 127 MAYGEN offers millions to billions of potential decoy molecules -an astronomical number of negative data points to work with. Henceforth, benchmarking and validation studies should not be lacking in proper negative data.",
  "This emphasizes the importance of good instrument tuning, to remove false-positive signals as well as maximise sensitivity. In truth there are many other such sources in ToF spectra, such as scattered ions, unwanted fragmentation, and sample background and contaminants, so a fraction of a percent offscourings from rare intense peaks is not hugely significant. However, these peaks are theoretically easy to detect, and could be subtracted in postprocessing should they prove an issue.",
  "For our comparison study, we opted to use LnNi II (otolyl)(Cl) precatalysts (1-3) for their ease of synthesis, air stability, and defined speciation. These precatalysts have been demonstrated to be viable in Ni-catalyzed SMCs, undergoing activation through transmetalation with excess boronic acid followed by reductive elimination to generate the active Ni 0 intermediate. 13c , Further, the use of this precatalyst platform obviates the need for air-and temperature-sensitive Ni(COD)2.",
  "Definitive evidence of formation of the heteroleptic sandwich came from single crystal Xray analysis. The molecular structure is similar to the homo-sandwich 12•Li8 (Fig. ) and its formula can be written as [(THF)3Li]2//1//Li5//2//Li(THF)3, abbreviated as 1•2•Li8. Both decks coordinate externally to three cations in total, whereas five Li + cations are jammed in between the Quantum-chemical calculations, at various levels of theory (Fig. ), confirmed that [18]annulene undergoes a dramatic change in geometry on reduction to the dianion, and provide insights into the causes of this conformational switch. Schleyer showed that density functionals with a high proportion of exact exchange (EE) are needed to properly describe annulenes 15 . Thus we optimised the geometries of three possible conformers (A, B, and C) of 1 0 and 1 2-using a range of functionals with EE = 37.5-54 %. We then evaluated the energies of these optimised geometries at the highly accurate coupled clusters singles, doubles, and perturbative triples level , DLPNO-CCSD(T*)-F12 (Fig. and; Section 7.3 of the SI). In the neutral aromatic state, the virtually D6h conformer 1A 0 has the lowest energy (Fig. ), whereas in the antiaromatic dianion the less symmetric conformer 1B 2-(five inner and 13 outer protons) is more stable (Fig. ).",
  "Since the individual Lut intramolecular vibrational frequencies and normal modes that describe the harmonic motion are about a local minimum reference geometry, a reasonable sampling of the protein conformations is necessary in order to account for the fluctuations on the ground-state potential. Our group recently reported a conformational landscape of CP29, explored through enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations (in protein membrane) starting from the Cryo-EM structure from spinach (PDB: 3JCU 31 ). Herein, we have selected 113 structures of CP29 from this conformational landscape that are well representative of the Cryo-EM geometry as well as the extremes of the landscape. All the sampled structures were refined using a three layer QM/MM optimization: 24 a mobile QM part composed solely of Lut treated at the DFT B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory, a mobile MM part composed of residues within 6 Å of Lut, and a fixed MM part that includes the rest of the system (i.e., pigments, lipids, waters, and protein). The protein and lipids were described using AMBER ff14SB 32 and lipid14 33 force fields, respectively, water molecules using TIP3P, while ad-hoc parameters were used for the pigments. The QM/MM frequency calculations were also performed using the same method, but keeping the whole MM part frozen. These calculations were carried out with the Gaussian 16 37 software.",
  "Effects on dielectric constants and enthalpies of vaporization lack clear trends relative to the uncertainty of the calculations themselves. Simulations of deuterated systems reveal similar but reduced effects, with isotope-induced changes generally within the statistical uncertainty, except for molar volume. This suggests deuteration often underestimates the full extent of NQEs, as a quantum treatment of deuterium still impacts properties.",
  "We conclude this section by comparing the results with vDSSB for ABFE with the BAR-based RBFE reported in Table . vDSSB-ABFE are uniderctional estimate relying on the convolution of the bound state annihilation work distribution with the unbound state growth work histogram. The ABFE for the thirteen guest of SAMPL9 are tabulated as the first entry in Table of Ref. They include the volume due to the receptor-ligand restraint (Eq. 8 of Ref. ) and the so-called finite-size correction (FSC) that applies to charged ligands (Eq. 9 of Ref. ). For RBFE, while volume correction does not apply, FSC must be accounted for when in the tansmutation the net charge of the ligand varies.

CCC is satisfied for the three-edges cycles with errors largely within the edge confidence intervals summed in quadrature. Remarkably CCC is still satisfied within the confidence interval in cycles up to six edges, irrespective of changes in chemical similarity, ligand charge, volume or number, and nature of rings.",
  "In this system, three terms from equation 10 could potentially contribute to lifting spin degeneracy: ĤR , ĤSOI , and ĤEs . The influence of the Rashba SOI, as mentioned earlier, is generally negligible, leading to energy splittings of only a few meV. Conversely, atomic SOI for high-atomic-number elements can easily be on the order of 1 eV. Similarly, the electrostatic Hamiltonian can also facilitate the experimentally observed energy splitting scale, as p p p • E E E s ∼ eÅ × V/Å ∼ eV . Therefore, both new terms may contribute to the generation of GSS in the presence of nonvanishing OAM.",
  "Transition temperatures were analyzed using a DMA instrument (TA Instruments' DMA Q800 V21.3 Build 96, TA Instruments, USA, equipped with 18 N load cell) in a tensile mode, heating from -50 to 150 ℃ at 3 ℃ min -1 with an amplitude displacement of 15 μm and a frequency of 1 Hz (Figure ).",
  "So far, caging of primary amines by Cy7 has been elusive as they are not compatible with the original synthetic approach that relies on payload introduction prior to the Zincke chemistry. This limitation may stem from the used acetate, which potentially abstracts the N-H group. However, our protocol now enables rapid caging of primary amines, typically completed in less than 30 mins. For example, benzylic amine 7d, dopamine 7f, and serotonin 7eessential hormones and neurotransmitters -were successfully caged with moderate yields (54-56%). It should be highlighted that the ability to install primary amines in Cy7 photocages therefore marks a significant milestone facilitated by this protocol.",
  "These results also provide guidelines for cell assembly and CE reporting. Researchers usually apply intuitively fair, self-consistent methods. We showed that such testing of electrolytes in coin cells was indeed sufficient to obtain relatively accurate rank agreement with literature. However, literature benchmarks, which are a composite of measurements by many researchers certainly not measured under identical cell configurations, more closely follow the best performance achievable with a given electrolyte, regardless of how the cell was constructed. Given that it is still not common practice to report internal cell assembly variables in publications, these findings provide one example of why researchers may struggle to replicate prior literature data despite following disclosed testing procedures.",
  "To study the evolution of the systems over time, we performed AIMD simulations of the O( 1 D) insertion reactions into the different hydrocarbons in the study. AIMD simulations were performed with the extended multi-state complete active space second-order perturbation theory (XMS-CASPT2) method within the so-called \"left SS-SR\" contraction scheme for internally contracted basis functions in which a vertical shift set to 0.2 E h was used.",
  "Synthesis of the (PBP)IrH4 complex 7 was approached from both 3 and 4, treating THF solutions of the selected (P N B N P)Ir species with 1 equivalent of Li[HAl(O t Bu)3] (LTBA) under 1 atm H2 to generate 7 quantitatively in situ. To our surprise, workup inevitably generated an impurity of 4 regardless of the starting complex, resulting in 90% pure 7 when starting from 3 (70% yield) or 98% pure 7 when starting from 4 (97% yield). We hypothesize that the interaction between 7, silica gel, and chlorides of Li or Al can produce a small amount of 4 during workup. Nonetheless, single crystals of 7 were grown by slow evaporation of pentane from a 98% pure material.",
  "In the case of the \"tail-to-tail\" molecular dimer (Figure , J c ), COHP analysis reveals that the strongest lobe-pair interactions at equilibrium involve the lobes positioned on the molecular center, namely lobes 3, 5, and 7 (Figure ), arising from the large HOMO expansion coefficients of the sulfur and alkene carbon atoms, namely a S• • • π interaction.",
  "line shape, and a densified layer restricted to the topmost layers is consistent with the XAS (Fig ). Consequently, the experimental O K-edge RSL feature can be a manifestation of pure NiO RSL or some Li-trapped RSL forming the LixNi1-xO phases. However, the Li + transport properties differ between these RSL members. Using the AIMD framework, we simulate the time domain of a LNO surface during charge to investigate Li-ion transport properties under the presence of the RSL layers. Charging is introduced via a constant electric field perpendicular to the RSL layer.",
  "[4n]annulenes outer (inner) protons are shielded (deshielded). These effects can be attributed to diatropic (for [4n+2]) and paratropic (for [4n]) ring currents which in turn arises from cyclic π-electron delocalization . It is well known that NMR shielding tensors are influenced by rovibratory effects (vibratory motion) while the translation motion can be safely ignored .",
  "The reference r e values for 17 lanthanide diatomics are available, including other spectroscopic constants, from calculations using a composite method exceeding the CCSD(T) level of theory. Our calculations are performed by placing the two atoms 1 Å apart in a 10×10×10 Å box, and then relaxing the structure with the BFGS algorithm using the default convergence criteria (change in energy between steps dE < 10 mRy, maximum force F < 1 mRy/a 0 ) and a range of DFAs. The calculations are spin-unrestricted, with a Γ-centered 3 × 4 × 3 Monkhorst-Pack k-point grid, and energy cut-offs of 65 Ry and 780 Ry for the wavefunction and density, respectively. While this computational approach may be unusual for isolated gas-phase systems, it was used to maintain consistency with the method used for extended systems, below. For completeness, comparison with results performed with Γ-point only and the Makov-Payne correction for isolated systems are shown in Fig. .",
  "This program filters out unfinished Gaussian calculations, non-optimised geometries and those with incorrect first frequencies, < 0 for geometry and > 0 for TS. In the case of constrained (TS) searches, it further rejects geometries associated to comparable energies and frequencies, which are assumed to be redundant. The criterion for energy is set at 10 -6 a.u., and at the matching integer value (in cm -1 ) for frequencies. A final refinement of the TS geometries is achieved by rejection of calculations presenting imaginary frequency less than 0.5 times the one given in input. The resulting conformer ensemble is then used for a subsequent larger-basis set DFT calculation.",
  "We synthesised a panel of 29 novel azobenzenes and azoheteroarenes (PST-6-32, Fig 2 ) to test these structural variations, primarily by diazonium couplings (see Supporting Information). Their photophysical properties, including E and Z isomer absorption spectra, PSS compositions, wavelengths giving the highest proportion of Z isomer, reversibility of photoswitching, and Z→E relaxation half-lives t1/2 in aqueous media, were determined in vitro (key compounds in Fig 2c , others in Table and Fig S1 ).",
  "Whereas impressive yield prediction performance (R 2 is around 0.9) has been achieved in many high-throughput experiment (THE) datasets, the yield prediction R 2 score on large literature datasets is usually unsatisfying .

  "Currently, the focus lies on the macro scale investigating thermal management and control of load-flexible single-stage reactors , and the link of reactor operation with the meso scale by the design of special catalyst pellets controlling the thermal management of the reactor . The latter investigations giving an impressive insight into the tolerance of load-flexible reactors by a multi-scale approach. However, these latter activities focus on the energy balance and neglect tolerance aspects arising from the unsteady-state sorption processes at the catalyst surface. A possible pathway to implement transient, intrinsic processes on the micro scale was most recently presented by for CO2 methanation reaction with focus on the catalyst surface .",
  "CuO nanoparticles have been synthesized by various routes like colloidal thermal synthesis, solid state reaction, reflux condensation, thermal decomposition, sol gel, sonochemical, hydrothermal etc. Doping with cation can be used to tailor the electrical, magnetic and optical properties.

  "A representative snapshot of the low conductance mode observed during the force field based MD simulations served as starting structure for our QM/MM simulations. The MiMiC interface was used to couple Gromacs 63 and Cpmd. The QM part comprises a calcium ion at Site 1 together with its first hydration shell and was treated with planewave and pseudopotential based Density Functional Theory (DFT), while the MM part of the system was described by the same force field as in the classical MD simulations. The Born-Oppenheimer Molecular Dynamics (BOMD) scheme was used with a timestep of 0.5 fs to simulate the system at 303 K. A simulated annealing followed by a linear re-heating was carried out before the production phase (42 ps in total, see Supplementary Information for details).",
  "All of the calculations were performed at the DFT level of theory with the B3LYP hybrid functional as implemented in Gaussian 16. To describe the dispersion properly, an explicit dispersion correction term called GD3, was also employed in the DFT calculations. The 6-311G (d,p) basis set was used for all the atoms (except for Br) involved in this study during both the geometry optimization and the single-point calculation processes. The Stuttgart/Dresden pseudo-potential basis set SDD, as well as a d-polarization function (ζ=0.428), is used for Br atom.",

  "Importantly, the redox reversibility of both redox couples of the telluroviologen host is generally maintained in the presence of anions, highlighting that ChB potency and anion binding can be judiciously reversibly switched OFF by redox control. As discussed in more detail in a later section, the sensory performance of this simple ChB voltammetric anion sensing system and redox-switch compares very favourably with a range of more elaborate XB or HB redox active systems (see Figure ).",
  "In both translation attempts, top performing molecular representation was ECFP4. The top accuracy reached to 93.1%, indicating that the model reflects an optimal level of fragment specificity within a fixed length vector. Alongside the performance of ECFP4, TT, HashAP, and AEs yield competitive accuracy, whereas the worst performance is observed in MACCS, omitting the ECFP0. It should be noted here that ECFP0 attempts to represent five million molecules using only 100 tokens in such a way that produced fragments are over-general. It is clear that ECFP0",

  "The lowest energy pathway towards N2(g) formation on Ir, Rh, and their alloyed surfaces is shown to proceed via the Oswin-Salomon mechanism, involving the adsorption and full dehydrogenation of two NH3(g) molecules to *N, and their subsequent coupling and desorption. Despite experimental evidence favoring the Gerischer-Mauerer mechanism for AOR on Ir(111), previous DFT studies on AOR activity on transition-metal surfaces suggest that high transition state energies for *N-N coupling lead to less thermodynamically favored pathways being more active due to superior kinetics. In all cases, the limiting step for *N2(g) formation is the dehydrogenation *NH3 to *NH2. The mixed metal alloys and pure Rh stabilize AOR intermediates too strongly, limiting activity by desorption of product. However, the overall most stable Ir50Rh50, which is an ordered structure consisting of a top layer of Rh, shows an improved limiting potential relative to pure Ir, and a downhill chemical coupling step, suggesting improved activity relative to both of the pure metals.",
  "In a subsequent work, we improved our original approach . For example, it is known that explicitly taking into account explicit water molecules improves the agreement between calculated and experimental pKa values on these species. We therefore repeated our calculations with one explicit water molecule donating an hydrogen-bond to the sulfur atom in the thiolate and thiol species. We also used another functional that was shown to perform well in these conditions and a more extended and diffuse bases set. We obtained overall better agreement with the experiments, and the correct trends were successfully predicted for almost 10 different organic thiols. Such a naive strategy could thus reasonable well account for the experimental results. Further free-energy calculations at an increased level of details (such as a mixed quantum/classical approach coupled with a force perturbation) could bring a decisive molecular point of view in order to rationalize the effects of eg. solvation or bond orientation and accessibility.",
  "Therefore, the observed trend of FWHM could be due to the smaller nanosheets that can stack more easily, and form ordered crystallites, resulting in a sharper 100 Bragg reflection. Similarly, because well-stacked 2D material means more accessible voids, this explains the increase in measured BET surface area of COF samples as a function of the reduction of residence time.",
  "Nevertheless, the predicted anti: endo ratio in the first 200 fs matched the experimental measurements over 4 hours. The ML photodynamics simulations suggested that the anticonfiguration is favored because its S1/S0 crossing regions are more accessible than the endoconfiguration. The predicted intermediates in QC NAMD simulations raise a fundamental question on the prediction reliability of the CASSCF(4,3)/ANO-S-VDZP calculations simulating the photochemical reaction of norbornyl cyclohexa-1,3-diene. With ML accelerations, we extended the simulations to 1 ns to monitor the subsequent dynamics of the intermediates. The trajectories showed continued thermal isomerization of the intermediate back to reactant in 1 ns (Figure ). This finding confirmed the metastability of the intermediates and explained their absence in the experiments. This example highlighted the advantages of ML photodynamics simulations in studying complex (photo)chemical reaction mechanisms involving elusive and long-lived intermediates.",

  "We have shown that by using MST and leveraging the intrinsic fluorescence of Trp that it is possible to extract both KD and KP of AMPs towards models of zwitterionic and anionic lipid bilayers in a fast and label-free manner. While the extraction of the binding parameters is challenging due to potential interference from light scattering effects and lipid system disassembly events at the extreme high and low lipid concentrations respectively -we believe this is offset by the much faster acquisition time, simplicity of protocol and sample requirements that MST enables, and the method produces reliable results that are comparable to established methods and protocols.",
  "Further support for the SET mechanism is presented in the kinetic PpyWT luciferase study . Significant kinetic isotope effect value (~ 2.1) was produced with the 4-deutero-D-LH2-AMP which implies C4 deprotonation as a rate limiting step. Other evidence was uncovered with anaerobic incubation of enzyme-substrate complex before oxygen introduction which resulted in fast (400 ms rise time) luminescence emission . Hence, the PpyWT luciferase rate determining step clearly occurs before oxidation and should involve a proton transfer from the C4 carbon.",
  "We found that paired prenatal urine and serum samples have different enrichment of chemical features (Figure ), despite some endogenous chemicals showing a significantly higher proportion in the serum samples (Spreadsheet S1).

  "The extended enolate can then undergo aldol addition at C4 with the neighboring ketone and isomerize to give rise to intermediate 14. Being sp 2 -hybridized, the enolate at C12 is preferentially protonated from the convex face, giving 15 as a single diastereomer. Overall, this Michael addition and aldol cascade forges two bonds and four stereocenters as a single diastereomer in high yield, crucially providing the correct stereochemistry at C12.",
  "Polymer and solution preparation: TBAPSS was prepared by dialysing NaPSS with a 50 molar excess of TBABr against DI water until the conductivity of the bath did not increase beyond the value of DI water when exposed to atmosphere for at least 24 hours. Solutions were freeze dried under a vacuum (∼ 0.4 mbar) and the resulting polymer was used to prepare the solutions.

  "Consequently, we increased the theoretical quality of the DFT level using the \"Swiss army knife\" r 2 SCAN-3c composite electronic structure method, which uses the meta-GGA r 2 SCAN exchangecorrelation functional, 12 a tailor-made triple-ζ Gaussian atomic orbital def2-mTZVPP basis, def2-mTZVPP/J auxiliary basis sets, and the DFT-D4 (version 2.5) dispersion model. This method can accurately calculate the van der Waals electronic dispersion energies between reactants and the interactions between the ozone molecule and the aromatic bonds of organic cations reproducing the first step of the Criegee mechanism with intermediate adduct formation in the process of organic cation degradation. We employed the ORCA code (version 5.0.3). Furthermore, determining the degradation mechanism requires calculation of the energy barriers between the reactant and product states (activation energies). To calculate these activation energies",
  "Accessing piperazine-fused 1,2-thiaselenanes (SeSPs) faces two challenges: ring fusion diastereoselectivity (cis/trans), and regioselective chalcogen installation (SeS/SSe), that both were predicted to completely determine the biological selectivity. For diastereoselectivity, we could adapt routes to cis-/trans-piperazinefused disulfides that we previously 9 built by subjecting E/Z-olefins to Minakata's 1,2-anti-diamination then Ritter's 1,2-electrophile vinyl thianthrenium (VTT). However, we found no precedent to regioselectively access the desired Se-proximal probes (SeSC type) rather than the Se-distal control (SSeC type), so developing a scalable regiopure synthesis became our main focus. We aimed to set up orthogonal N-protecting groups in a common precursor 7, that could be removed selectively: e.g. replacing PG 1 to create Se-proximal probes, or PG 2 for Se-distal controls (Figure ).",

  "In support of this, MIL125 is selected for further scrutiny due to the fact that it was considered in the aggregate analysis as one of 26 nominally hydrophobic MOFs. More importantly, independent analysis of this material has been published in a study that has delivered a characteristic curve over a temperature range of 20 o C to 50 o C . The curve indicates reasonable conformance with Polanyi potential model with data in the loading range near the POI. Furthermore, independent application of the Ising model to assess isosteric heat of adsorption in MIL125 shown on While it is possible for computational methods based on molecular dynamic simulations to also reproduce relationships between inflection points and pore size, there are important advantages of IMMKA whose analytic form offers simplicity of use without computational expense.

  "The restraining scheme by Clark et al. was proposed for use in ABFE calculations and an analytical correction was used to account for its contribution. However, in our system, since the ligands are not annihilated, an ef@icient end-point correction was applied to get their contribution as described in the next section. In principle, the contribution of the protein-ligand restraints can be obtained using windowing methods such as FEP or TI as end-point corrections. However, FEP or TI would increase the computational cost of the work@low. We used the one-step perturbation (OSP) method instead, as it requires the simulation of a single reference state. The free energy of adding the restraints on the X-ray (QN )*+,→)*+, * * :26 ) was obtained using the thermodynamic cycles shown in Figures and, respectively. The reference state is de:ined by assigning ! = 0.5 for both the X-ray and the :lipped poses in the protein-ligand complex; both the poses still have the multiple distance restraints to the protein, but the force constant was reduced to half.",
  "Inspired by the emerging area of late stage skeletal editing in cyclic organic scaffolds, we were curious whether we could similarly enact a single-atom Si-to-Ge transmutation in sila-diamondoid cores. We were particularly drawn to the \"germanium shuttling\" approach previously disclosed by Marschner, Müller, and coworkers, who found that linear and cyclic oligosilanes internalize terminal Ge atoms to the most heavily branched positions upon Lewis acid treatment, thermodynamically driven by the formation of stronger Si-C bonds (relative to Ge-C bonds) and hyperconjugation interactions, among other factors. Here we find that this chemistry extends to the skeletal 4˚ editing of sila-adamantane.",
  "To compare the performance of docking after fingerprint screening using the FASTDock cluster, we compare our docking results with those from docking after screening using the bound ligand from the co-crystal structure used in initial probe mapping. Moreover, to determine whether the fingerprint screening step increases overall binder enrichment, we also compare active recovery after docking with no prior filtering to our filtering results. For the case with no filtering, all molecules in the DUD-E dataset for HIV protease are used in rigid receptor docking. In both cases of pre-filtering, molecules with a TANIMOTO coefficient of 0.5 or greater to the reference are used for docking.",

  "Recent work has been advocating for a \"CAS without SCF\" by employing methods and techniques to predict the orbitals to reduce the computational work needed. Building on that momentum comes a few methods to accelerate the selection of the active space. There has been an ambiguity about a good predictor for virtual orbitals generation for CAS methods, with some using the exchange integrals , MP2 t-amplitudes , or natural occupation from various approximations . One interesting advancement in ML came from using all of them in a classifier system that predicts if the orbital should be included or not . Note that this does not create virtual orbitals that minimize the CAS energy; rather, it simply selects among them.",
  "Our findings advocate for the adoption of unfamiliarity over traditional, similarity-based methods for applicability domain definition. Moreover, since unfamiliarity bears promise to reveal distribution shifts that would be undetected through molecular similarity or underestimated by uncertainty-based approaches, we recommend its adoption when screening largescale molecular libraries. Crucially, because the unfamiliarity landscape reveals gaps in a model's learned distribution, its applications could assist in guiding reinforcement learning applications or extend beyond 'one-shot' virtual screening to iterative approaches such as active learning to guide molecule acquisition. Ultimately, our study highlights the advantages of joint modeling not only in de novo design applications but also in capturing structureactivity relationships. The information provided by joint modeling and unfamiliarity is expected to drive the development of more reliable and generalizable models -accelerating the exploration of novel regions in the chemical space with greater confidence and precision.",

The orthorhombic periodic box were set 12 Å away from the protein and the 10x10x18 Å box was consisting by ca. 140 lipids and 22,000 TIP3P water molecules, 172 using the System Builder utility of Desmond v4.9 (Schrödinger Release 2021-1: Desmond Molecular Dynamics System, D. E. Shaw Research, New York, NY, 2021. Maestro-Desmond Interoperability Tools, Schrödinger, New York, NY, 2021). Sodium and chloride ions were added randomly in the water phase to neutralize the systems and reach the experimental salt concentration of 0.150 M NaCl. The total number of atoms of the complex was approximately 100,000 and the simulation box dimensions was (86 x 83 x 141 Å 3 ). We used the Desmond Viparr tool to assign the amber99sb force field (ff99sb) parameters for the calculation of the protein, lipids and intermolecular interactions, and the Generalized Amber Force Field (GAFF) 173 parameters for the ligands.

  "To evaluate CPG suitability as solid support, synthesis by the Fmoc/tBu strategy, the most widely used for current (batchwise) applications, was first explored. A conventional Fmoc-rink amide linker was accordingly selected as anchoring to build three sequences, namely the tetrapeptide DKFG-amide (requiring protection at the K (Boc) and D (tBu) side chains), and the more demanding octapeptide epitope APTAPLPG-amide (no side chain protections required). The satisfactory purities (94% and 96%) achieved allowed to conclude that CPG was a workable option to build peptides on a glass support by Fmoc/tBu SPPS. The next step, discussed below, was exploring the feasibility of CPG-supported SPPS using acid-based deprotection strategies suitable with the ultimate goals of the project.",

The crystal structure of GDO does not contain a dioxygen molecule. To prepare the enzyme model system, a dioxygen is manually added to the iron center.

  "The main advantage over Fourier transform mass instruments such as the Orbitrap analyzer is sensitive single ion detection, and short flight times that allow modern instruments to acquire data within 10s microseconds to milliseconds, and deliver spectra at well over 100 Hz . A relative shortcoming is typically resolving power, a consequence of limited flight path length and the time-focal spread of ions at the detector surface. It is common to employ an electrostatic ion mirror, which may serve both parameters as it compensates for energy variation as well as folding a longer flight path within the available volume . When interfaced to continuous ion sources, such instruments suffer from high ion losses, even when orthogonal acceleration is employed . Meanwhile, use of a trap, like C-trap, to alleviate such losses, results in drastic loss of resolution .",

  "We have enhanced the capabilities of the open-source software RMG for heterogeneously catalyzed reactions to cope with the complexity of multidentate adsorbates. New reaction families were added and generalized rate rules were parameterized with ab-initio calculations. RMG was applied in a test case to automatically generate mechanisms for the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of C 2 H 6 on Pt(111), an essential process for the formation of ethylene. A reaction mechanism that consisted of around 90 % of elementary reactions involving bidentate species was discovered. Although the considered intermediates and species agree with the literature, the dominant pathway at the investigated temperature proceeds primarily via abstraction reactions pointing to further development directions for the catalysis branch of RMG. In conclusion, With the significant updates performed in this work, RMG can now explore reaction mechanisms for processes involving larger adsorbates.",

  "The quantum chemical calculations carried out in conjunction with the specific molecule (vitamin B3) considered in this study used the GAUSSIAN 16 suite of programs . Geometry optimizations without constraints, frequency calculations (checking that all vibrational frequencies were real), and electronic energies were done at the DFT level of theory using the hybrid B3LYP exchange correlation functional and 6-311G(d,p) and 6-311++G(d,p) basis sets . The solvent (water) was treated within the polarized continuum model (PCM) using the integral equation formalism (IEF) . Similar to other cases studied recently , spin contamination did not appear to be an issue for the unrestricted spin (UB3LYP) approaches, as witnessed by the values of the total spin values S 2 before and after annihilation of the first spin contaminant presented in the following. For reasons explained below, we also performed restricted open shell (ROB3LYP) calculations, which are more demanding computationally for larger molecules. The small differences between the unrestricted and restricted open shell methods revealed that dynamical electron correlations brought about by spin polarization effects are weak; still, they should make it clear that claims (often formulated in the literature on antioxidation) on chemical accuracy (∼ 1 kcal/mol) are totally unrealistic. Achieving chemical accuracy for bond dissociation enthalpies and proton affinity (BDE and PA, quantities entering the discussion that follows) is often illusory even for extremely computationally demanding state-of-the-art compound model chemistries (CBS-QB3, CBS-APNO, G4, W1BD) and smaller molecular sizes .",

Pilatus300k detector was used for data collecting, and sample-detector distance was 1.3m. The minimum projection method for a series of images was used to reduce background noise (12 frames with 1h exposition). Norm wave vector s (s = 2sinθ/λ, where θ is Bragg angle) was calibrated via several orders of AgBe. The data were corrected for the solvent scattering and processed using standard procedures with a program suit ATSAS . Atomistic molecular dynamic was carried out using GROMACS package version 2024 . Starting structure consisted of spherically arranged monomers (pre-micelle) solvated in water with salt concentration of 150 mM. Number of monomers(190) was chosen so that radius of gyration of simulated micelles(trajectory average) was consistent with experimental value derived from SAXS data. GROMOS 54A7 force field topologies for monomers were generated using Automated Topology Builder . Pre-micelles were minimized with turned off non-bonded interactions in order to decouple overlapping atoms. Next, a short 60 ps simulated annealing stochastic dynamic run was performed to reach global minimum. After energy minimization and two 10 ps equilibration runs in NVT and NPT ensembles, 450 ns production run was performed using the NPT ensemble with periodic boundary conditions applied (P = 1 bar and T = 298 K). Non-bonded interactions were calculated using the cutoff distance of 1 nm. Long-range electrostatic interactions were calculated by the PME method and the MD integration time step was set to 1.6 fs. VMD1.9.3 was used for visualization. Fitting to experimental SAXS curve was performed using CRYSOL program from ATSAS package. First 350 ns were omitted for equilibration and remaining 100 ns (1000 frames) were used for processing including trajectory rotational fit to remove displacement of atoms caused by nanoparticle rotation, root mean square deviation (RMSD) calculation for surface atoms, extraction of frames with minimal, average and maximal RMSD over trajectory and topography maps generation. Topography generation was performed similarly to previous work .

  "In this work we have used a controlled pore glass (CPG) solid support as a demostration stage for SPPS on glass surfaces using acid-labile protection schemes. A 5-mer model peptide (FPXAG), with different residues at the X position, served to evaluate the feasibility of the method, which was extended to longer peptides as well as to peptides with DYK motifs suitable for antibody recognition. Overall, with isolated exceptions, the SPPS methodology developed for CPG proved quite robust and versatile, leading to high purity crude products and thus providing a valid proof of concept.

  "In Ref. 74 it was concluded that the charge-neutrality condition leads to breaking the spatial independence charge distribution. In other words, only a positiondependent multiplier can satisfy the correct ion density and concentration as well as electrostatic potential limits far from the DFT region. Choosing a local, ion independent constraint, µ 0 ± (r) ≈ µ 0 (r), will effectively result in an ionic cavity function which depends on the charge state of the DFT subsystem. This would likely allow the ions to penetrate deeper in the DFT region. Thus, ions would reside within the solvent cavity resembling specific adsorption which is outside the applicability of PB-like approaches as highlighted while deriving the continuum GC-DFT approach. Also large ion concentrations would be observed close to the nuclei. These considerations apply also to ionic exclusion models presented in Refs. 37 and 29.",

  "The two scenarios demonstrate that the reaction encoder can generate meaningful reaction fingerprints for querying similar re-actions, respecting both the functional groups in the reaction center and features away from the center without knowing the functional groups a priori. The results indicate capabilities beyond previous reaction query systems that depend on matching predefined reaction templates defined by functional groups. Furthermore, we note that the reaction encoder can be applied to reaction classes and mechanisms that are very different from any provided in the training data, although care should be taken to not extrapolate inappropriately to avoid unbounded uncertainty 57 .",
  "To calculate PESs quantum mechanically, the initial wave packets were assumed to arise from a vertical transition from the anion, in accord with the Condon approximation. The wave functions for the (rotationless) 00, 51, and 11 anion vibrational states were obtained by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian in Equation 2 using the Lanczos method. Wave packets were propagated along the neutral potential energy surface, developed by Han et al. using the same PIP-NN method.",
  "Another possibility for the second decay component is relaxation of the vibrationally hot ground state formed from by passage through the La→gr CI. Based on previous UV-VIS TA and TR-IR studies, repopulation of the thermalized ground state recovery is complete within ~2 ps of photoexcitation for all three NACs. Pecourt et al. calculated the initial vibrational temperature in the ground state to be ~1200 K assuming that all the electronic energy released by internal conversion to the ground state is converted to vibrational energy that undergoes intramolecular vibrational redistribution before any cooling by the solvent.",
  "In the workflow to prioritize features according to their likelihood of being PFAS, several pieces of evidence are calculated individually for all detected features in the first place. For all MS 1 features, the number of carbon atoms, MD, and both MD/C and m/C-dimensions are determined.

  "AutoTST is an automated algorithm to locate reactant, product, and transition state (TS) geometries using quantum chemical calculations, to arrive at reaction rate expressions. AutoTST was originally built as a module within the Reaction Mechanism Generator (RMG) software and could determine modified Arrhenius parameters from RMG reaction objects matched to one of three specific reaction families: unimolecular hydrogen migration (1 reactant to 1 product), radical addition to a multiple bond (2 reactants to 1 product), and bimolecular hydrogen abstraction (2 reactants to 2 products). Bhoorasingh noted that this was a sizable step in automated kinetic calculations, but the workflow needed some improvements. This work addresses these improvements to increase fidelity and speed of calculations, such as including a detailed conformer search, 1-D hindered rotor approximations, graph based symmetry number calculations, and parallelization of calculations using the Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM) job scheduler. We observe these changes by recalculating reaction rates present in the Lawerence Livermore National Lab's (LLNL) butanol model by Sarathy and co-workers , comparing to benchmark calculations, and assessing the impact on iginition delay time predictions of the whole model.",
  "The rate constant for the photoinduced charge transfer reaction (Ci' in the ErCi' mechanism) can be determined mathematically from voltammograms when in zone KD or KS, which are the zones observed in this work. In these experiments, the observed rate in the experiment (kobs) is related to the scan-rate independent plateau current (ic) observed in zone KS and zone KD by Equation , where n is the number of electrons transferred at the electrode, and ip and ν are the peak current and scan rate for a reversible, dark experiment. Notably, this equation does not require any knowledge of the diffusion coefficient or concentration of the redox probe because the currents are taken as a ratio.",

  "Finally, several intriguing properties/applications of NMFs are demonstrated, including compression-induced dark-to-shining transition, devisable self-propulsion behavior, and high electrocatalytic activity towards ethanol/methanol oxidation. This study provides not only a conceptual-new and general route to fabricate and on-demand manipulate noble metal foams, but also certain perspectives in understanding the gelation process and underlying mechanism, therefore paving the way for on-target designing versatile NMFs for various applications. Due to the enormous ion library and the generality of the gelation mechanism, the presented method may also adapt to versatile colloidal solution systems for on-demand manipulation towards desirable applications.",

  "All activation energies are reported as free energies at room temperature calculated with respect to the most energetically stable reactant conformer. All reactant and TS energies are reported based on the single point energy plus the zero point energy correction and the room temperature thermal contributions to the molecular enthalpy and entropy estimated using a harmonic partition function calculated based on the normal mode frequencies. These quantities correspond to the standard values calculated and reported in Gaussian 16. 3 Results",
  "Although many shallow learner algorithms have been developed to score ligandprotein binding affinity, fewer shallow models are available for pose classification. Pei et al.'s pose classification model was trained and tested exclusively on the CASF-2016 dataset precluding direct comparison with our results. Instead, we include a baseline RF model (RF_i) using the calculated interaction features also considered supplemental information to the deep learning models, in order to motivate the potential benefits of our proposed deep learning modeling with 3D atomic representations. The input of this RF baseline model is the same as the protein-ligand interaction features used in 3D-CNN and PCN. It was implemented using scikit-learn Python library with the default parameters (number of trees = 100, the minimum number of samples for split = 2, criterion = Gini impurity).",

Diffraction-quality crystals were obtained via methods presented in the experimental section. Diffraction intensity data were measured at 100 K with a Bruker Kappa diffractometer equipped with a CCD detector, employing either Mo Kα (λ = 0.71073 Å) radiation, with the SMART suite of programs. Data were processed with SAINT and SADABS. Structural solution and refinement were carried out with the SHELXTL suite of programs. In general, non-hydrogen atoms with occupancies greater than 0.5 were refined anisotropically. Carbon-bound hydrogen atoms were included in idealised positions and refined using a riding model. Disorder was modelled using standard crystallographic methods including constraints, restraints and rigid bodies where necessary. Structures 3⊂ I -and 3⊂NO3 -displayed less that ideal diffraction properties with broad reflections and a significant amount of diffuse scatter. The structures are both 50 % disordered around a special position. Accordingly both the cation and the tertiary butyl groups were only modelled isotropically and a number of bond length restraints were required. Despite these limitations the connectivity is unambiguous.",
  "The interpretation of loadings obtained by applying PCA to PDF operando measurements in terms of structural features was facilitated by prior static measurements on the same NiGraf samples . In said previous measurements, samples were characterized in terms of crystal phase identification and structural fitting. This prior characterization enabled us to interpret the loadings by leveraging the fact that the PDF profiles of the two crystal phases present in the samples have well-defined and separated characteristic peaks, located in the first 3.2 Å interatomic distances (Figure ). Two pairs of peaks were assigned to jamborite and GO phases. This assignment guided our interpretation of the loading values obtained through the PCA analysis.",
  "Our simulated model successfully predicts many trends observed during native-ESI-MS, including a recreation of the experimental tendency of -ESI to produce protein ions with lower charge states relative to +ESI. By linking these experimental observations to simulated data, our model suggests that changes in residue basicity during the transition from solution to gasphase play a significant role in moderating charging in electrosprayed droplets. Our simulations suggest that sprayed proteins maintain much native-like structure during the ESI process and subsequent release into the gas-phase.",

  "The most aggressive baseline models for H-CLMP(T) are our adaptions of the attention-based models from the literature, CrabNetMP(T) and RoostMP(T). These models both perform MPP using the generated DOS transfer learning and provide a practically identical standardized MAE of 0.505. The standardized MAE for H-CLMP(T) is 0.428, a 15% reduction due to the combination of VAE model alignment and hierarchical correlation learning (see Table ).",
  "DFT calculations were performed using Gaussian 16. For geometry optimizations, the ωB97X-D functional with the 6-31+G(d,p) basis set and the SMD solvation model for CH2Cl2 (a representative polar solvent) were used. Vibrational frequency analysis was used to confirm structures as either minima or transition structures (TSs) and to obtain thermodynamic corrections to enthalpy and free energy. Single-point energy (SPE) refinements were then obtained at the DLPNO-CCSD(T)/Def2-TZVPP level of theory. The free energies presented in the main text are obtained by adding the free energy corrections to the SPE. This combination of methods was shown to provide accurate results for the base C4H7 + system as well as the complex Marek system in our previous work.

  "The most apparent patterns amongst the favorable GAP mutants are observed with ionic residues. Close to the phosphate end of the active site and the Switch II loop, the removal of the positive charge of Arg903, or the introduction of a negative charge at Leu902 or Pro907 are highly beneficial for decreasing the reaction barrier. Interestingly, if the Ras.RGS3 complex is aligned to the Ras.p120GAP, the approximate position of Arg903 is taken up by an Asn residue (Figure ).

  "Finally, a 1 H NMR spectrum can be simulated purely from the numerical data shown in Table , with the code values treated as chemical shifts and the degeneracies as integrated intensities. The close agreement (Figure and inset) between this simulation and the experimental spectrum for the pyrene complex of copolymer Z (Figure ) is very striking and provides good evidence that the \"stopat-zero\" limitation is a real effect in such systems.",
  "We next screened cosolvents to methanol (Table , entries 11-25); toluene improved yields, with good results at 1:1 MeOH:PhMe (Fig 2 ). We also screened diluted conditions, since the solubility of PIDA is only moderate: but these lowered isolated yields greatly (Table , entry 26), coherent with the role of a dimeric intermediate (Scheme S2). PIDA was however superior to PIFA, oxone, or K2S2O8 as the oxidant, and increasing its loading (10 eq.) only reduced yields (Table , entries 27-32). This is coherent with expectations that excess or stronger oxidants drive parasitic oxidations of the increasingly electron-rich intermediates/product. Acidic, basic, or dehydrating additives also did not give improvements (Table , entries 33-40). Instead, reaction yields improved when Pd(OAc)2 loading was raised (Fig 2 ).",

  "As expected, the di(trispyrazolylborato)iron(II) framework displays remarkably robust spin crossover properties. With the exception of highly sterically hindered di-and tetra-4 nitro substituted compounds, which are locked in a high spin configuration, all substituted complexes reported here retain their spin crossover properties. While the transition parameters of the 3-substituted derivatives is essentially governed by steric considerations, electronic effects govern complexes substituted in position 4, which display transition temperatures ranging from 70 o C (diamino complex) to 130 o C (tetranitro complex). The investigation of the crossover properties, however, is complicated by the cooperativity effects due to crystal packing, and some observations, in particular concerning the behavior of [(Tp)Fe(5-NO 2 Tp)], remain unexplained.",

Embedding vectors provide an atomwize representation of a molecule, so a direct comparison with other chemical observables than energy (on which the SchNet architecture has been trained) ideally involves chemical observables of atomic nature. For this reason, we focused on pKa values and NMR shifts in the present study.",
  "Rietveld refinements were carried out using TOPAS academic V7. The structure model with space group Pnma (no. 62) was used as starting model. In the given order, the following parameters were refined: scale factor and background coefficients using a Chebyshev function with 12 free parameters, the peak shape using the fundamental parameter approach, the zero-shift error, the lattice constants, the atom positions and the isotropic atomic displacement parameters. Fit indicators of Rwp, Rexp, and GOF were used to assess the quality of the refined structural models. Quantum-chemical Calculations: Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and the computation of NMR parameters have been performed using the Quantum ESPRESSO package and GBRV pseudopotentials with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional as exchange-correlation functional.

The force convergence threshold was set to 10 -10 Ry/a.u., the convergence threshold for self-consistency to 10 -14 Ry and the total energy convergence threshold was set to 10 -13 Ry. The kinetic energy cutoff for wavefunctions was set to 100 Ry. The calculated results were converted via XCrysDen and VESTA 3 into a SHELX file in order to analyze the symmetry of the calculated structure with KPLOT.

  "Jäger's team later applied the same pH indication method to experimentally track evolution of RGB values in video recordings of rotary disc reactors. Armenante and co-workers used phenolphthalein's decolouration reactions to show agreement between experimental and CFD-generated blend times in a United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) compliant vessel. In a rare but interesting meta-analytical example, Hens' team employed image analysis to extract insights on velocity distributions using contour plots output from their CFD analyses of chlorination contact tanks. It is worth acknowledging the related imaging methods of particle image velocimetry (PIV) and planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) which represent powerful methods of capturing flow velocities and concentration fields, respectively. However, since laser-based techniques are typically more difficult to safely transfer across scales of operation, these methods are not considered in detail here.",

  "This can be because the TS connects to two van der Waals (vdW) wells rather than the bimolecular entrance or exit channels. These wells allow for intermolecular interactions to occur between reacting species that lower the potential energy of the complex, leading to a saddle point that can be submerged below the reactants or products. These errors were more common in abstraction reactions with oxygen-containing reactants (e.g abstraction by O --O, • OH, • OOH) which have strong vdW interactions. These errors might be addressed by treatment of vdW wells with a 3TS model solved with a Master Equation (ME), as is done in EStokTP . These barrier height errors account for almost all of the failures in the hydrogen abstraction reaction family.",

The code uses the momentum relaxation time approximation (MRTA) to calculate the scattering rates and carrier mobilities, and has demonstrated excellent agreement both to experimental measurements and highlyaccurate calculations (using EPW software ) of electron mobility and Seebeck coefficients for several semiconductors. Unlike the highly used BoltzTraP approach, this method does not assume a constant relaxation time and estimates one by considering a range of scattering processes.

  "The vanilla VAE usually suffers from posterior collapse, a phenomenon by which the network learns a trivial local optimum of the ELBO objective, causing the variational posterior to be severely misrepresented as the true posterior . He et al. demonstrate that posterior collapse can be mathematically represented as a local optimum of VAEs whereby both the encoder and decoder networks equivalently represent the latent output z as the prior distribution, shown in Eq. 2. The authors from show that posterior collapse simply occurs as a direct result of an underrepresented (or lagging) reconstruction loss. During training, vanilla (imbalanced) VAEs will equally weight the reconstruction and KL loss terms which leads to the network quickly optimizing the KL term, locating an inaccurate local optimum that poorly approximates the true posterior.",
  "Here, we approximately drew the potential energy surfaces (PESs) of a PhOH molecule in solutions using the MS-XMCQDPT2 under the theoretical framework previously constructed in Ref. .

  "Before studying the impact of Ta doping on oxygen release, we investigate the Ta substitution energy. Substitution was performed on a fully lithiated supercell at all geometrically invariant transition metal positions. Li and O positions were not considered . The selection of reservoirs for calculating substitution energies is not fixed and can vary based on the study's context, making the choice somewhat arbitrary. There are multiple sensible options for reservoirs depending on the specific needs of the calculation. One practical approach is to use native oxides as reservoirs for transition metals. This method reflects the natural oxidation states of the metals involved and the phases that form during calcination, providing a relevant and chemically intuitive baseline for evaluating the thermodynamics of substitution within a compound. Also this approach aligns with the chosen synthesis process of Ta-doped NMC and previous reports of doping induced side phases. The formulation refers to the reaction:",

Mechanical compression shortens the N:Sn nonbond and lengthens the Sn-I polar-covalent bond with an association of polarization.

  "Overall, photosynthetic reaction centers, and membrane-bound redox-active proteins in general, appear to act as nonergodic, nonlinear, and dynamically anisotropic chargetransport engines. To act as a microscopic engine (machine), the RC has to have a nonrandom bias, i.e., allow vectorial charge transport, sufficiently fast to compete with recombination channels. Driving forces of individual hops, borrowed from light's energy, provide directionality to electron transport. Directionality is additionally enforced by dynamic anisotropy. Both slow dispersive dynamics of membrane-bound proteins and slow conformational dynamics allow nonergodic medium statistics lowering both the activation barrier (eqs 9 and 10) and the free-energy cost for each hop (eq 5). Nonergodicity allowed by slow conformational dynamics suggests that redox chemistry of IDPs might follow the rules of nonergodic chemical kinetics.",

The TD component was fit by assuming that the TD products exited the surface in a MB distribution of translational energies, and for the TDslow component we assumed a convolution of a MB distribution and a 1 st -order exponential decay function. The IS component was assumed to be the remaining signal after subtracting the TD + TDslow components from the overall TOF distribution. Fig. shows representative fits for different TOF distributions. Each component of a TOF distribution may integrated appropriately to obtain flux, according to the relationship between number density and flux, ( ) /",
  "In other experiments involving magnetic tweezers, polyproteins could be manipulated under a very low force (typically, 2-20 pN) for a long period of time, which allowed to dynamically follow single domain unfolding/refolding under force. Equation 4 becomes no longer valid for several reasons: first, L F is not significantly larger than the folding length L f old , and second, one has to somehow include in the model a term reporting on the stabilization of the native state, and on the free-energy barrier to unfold the protein before it extends.",
  "are the reduced spin-density gradient, reduced spin-density Laplacian and reduced spin-density Hessian, respectively. Note that the B88 damping parameter is not reoptimized in the MH24 model. In contrast to LH20t 61 or LH23pt, 22 MH24 thus uses the same damping function in the CF and the GGA correction in the exchange functional, which is closer to the idea of the pig scheme. Using the simple one-parameter pig1-CF in contrast to the pig2-CF furthermore facilitates parameter optimization by preventing multiple minima in the CF optimization while still covering most issues arising from the gauge problem.",

  "In neutral BrU, efficient internal conversion to the S0 ground state combined with solvent caging inhibits C-Br dissociation. However, once an electron attaches, Br -formation is very facile through coupling to the dissociative σ * (C-Br) surface. Although most theoretical/experimental studies on DEA are in the gasphase, the characteristics of BrUˉ potential energy surfaces could be relevant to the DEA process involving pre-hydrated electrons in aqueous solutions. Several experimental observations on DNA sequences modified with BrU have demonstrated a strong correlation with pre-hydrated electrons generated by UV photon or low-energy electron irradiation, highlighting the role of BrU (and BrUrd) as a radiosensitizer in the context of anion chemistry.",
  "Therefore, the Ag/Al random mixing in the title compound, despite the atomic size mismatch, alongside the absence of significant phase width are puzzling, and the origin of this unexpected behavior may help to answer some remaining questions regarding the factors governing the stability of the TiNiSi type structure in general. Hence, to gain some critical insights into the stability factors and chemical bonding of the title phase CaAg0.5Al0.5Ge, LMTO band structure calculations were conducted on a hypothetical ordered model constructed by lowering the space group symmetry from Pnma to Pnm21. By doing this, the three atomic positions all at Wyckoff site 4c are split each into two crystallographically independent Wyckoff site 2a, in the maximum isomorphic subgroup of index 2 space group Pnm21 (No 31) so that the Ag/Al mixed site could be ordered into the two sites. Within the coloring problem approach, this model is just one representative of many possible local orderings or coloring models. Here, each Ge site remains tetra-coordinated with two Al and two Ag atoms (GeAl2Ag2) so that the AlGe4 and AgGe4 tetrahedra form two separated linear chains along the b-direction, and they are condensed by sharing edges. Some alternative models, not discussed here, will have these linear chains consisting of alternating AlGe4 and AgGe4 tetrahedra. Such models, go beyond the scope of this report, can only be built in large superstructures.",
  "The scaling exponent obtained from the OLS fitting would lead to a description of the junction formed from 2 involving less through-bond coupling, when in reality the value obtained from this method of analysis reflects the mechanical instability of the junction, and the greater data spread. The dataset is better analysed using the methods proposed here, which gives values much more consistent with the through-bond coupling mechanisms associated with the thioanisole anchor groups and the chemical nature of the molecule, albeit it increased from the idealised value 𝑛 = 1.",
  "Each AuNP was individually parameterized based on all-atom (AA) simulations through a bottomup approach to capture conformational effects that arise from ligand grafting to the AuNP surface. Simulations of the AuNPs at the AA scale used the CHARMM36 force field. Distributions of the bond lengths and angles were used to calculate the CG bonded parameters. The C5 beads that compose the hollow shell were bonded to their nearest C5 neighbors within 1.24 nm using a harmonic potential with a spring constant of 5,000 kJ mol -1 nm -2 to obtain a stable and rigid core. Specific details regarding this bottom-up parameterization can be found in our previous work .",
  "Figure describes a single-and multi-task BO loop for the setup discussed in Section 4.1.1 on a 12-parameter optimization problem, using the CRF described in Section 3.2. Both algorithms were allowed to do 25 experiments on the ground truth simulator. The MTGP could perform four biased simulator experiments per iteration and was initialized with 30 random biased simulator experiments. Both algorithms were initialized with five random ground truth experiments. All experiments were repeated for eight trials. It can be seen that the MTBO found reasonable optima with far fewer iterations, ascribing its applicability to the problem setting of LC×LC.

  "Notably, reaction (20) dominates Ag -decay at short time scales of 10 -5 -10 -3 s, despite its comparably sluggish reaction rate. Prior work showed that this mechanism accelerates the reduction of Ag + in the presence of silver nanoparticles containing Ag -on their surface. This is due to the relatively high Ag + precursor concentration and illustrates once more that reaction rate constants alone can cause misinterpretations of reaction network interplay. In contrast to previous, concentration independent graph visualizations of radiation chemistry networks, the node size corresponds to the concentration of the species and the lines display the reaction-specific generation rate. This provides a holistic overview of the activity of the entire network.",
  "Transport properties were calculated using a dense electronic structure calculation (10×20×10 k-mesh, then further interpolated) through the package AMSET. AMSET goes beyond the relaxation time approximation by simulating, using ab initio calculated materials properties such as the static dielectric constant, the dominant electronic scattering processes: acoustic deformation potential, polar optical phonon and ionized impurity scattering. In this way, it is possible to obtain a more sophisticated analysis of the contributions to the overall carrier mobility, and more accurate predictions of conductivity limits for real devices.",

This scheme is essential, as Rubisco's low binding affinity (high Michaelis constant, Km)",
  "For Ne evaporation, the two Maxwellian contributions have been integrated separately. Since the TOF spectra in Fig. (b) were fit by assuming a homogeneous Ne background at T bkg in the chamber, this component contributes a constant intensity at all angles (light blue triangles) in Fig. . The background-adjusted Ne component (the component at T liq , blue circles) again follows cosθ f , which further confirms that atoms and molecules with smaller van der Waals radii can escape the dodecane vapor region without undergoing enough gas-phase collisions to significantly distort their angular and velocity distributions. These results suggest that Ne scattering experiments may also be largely unaffected by beam-vapor collisions, a point that will be explored in the next section. The slightly super-Maxwellian TOF distribution shape at 0˚ and the slightly narrowed cosine angular distribution could, however, reflect the interaction potential between Ne and dodecane. 65, 73",

  "From this perspective, the nature of catalysis is the reactant bond elongation by the stronger electric field of the atomistic catalytic dipoles, and the extent of reactant bond elongation depends on the strength of the electric field. The BOLS-NEP and HBCP mechanisms should play their rules in dealing with water surface self-electrification and water-assisted catalysis in which the dipolar-substituted hydrogen bond formation and relaxation matter. Most HTSCs prefer a layered structure with structural gaps serving as transport channels. Dirac fermions of the undercoordinated surface atoms serve as carriers.

  "Our previous work using nano-DESI for native MS of proteins from tissue has required high-end mass spectrometers for reasons including their high mass resolving power, ion/ion reactions and ion mobility separation. An instrument suitable for native MS does not necessarily require a diverse set of functionality if its primary role is intact mass analysis for example, which piqued our interest in using the LTQ Velos Pro. We have found it necessary to use collisional activation on the highperformance instruments to generate declustered protein ions with usable signal quality.

  "the associated real-space-dependent two-center integrals over the Coulomb operator, commonly denoted as A matrix. In the same way as local hybrids, LRSLH functionals suffer from the so-called gauge problem caused by the local admixture of exchange energy densities. In particular, exchange energy densities as e ex x,σ and e lrsh x,σ are only defined up to a function integrating to a vanishing contribution in the exchange energy. Hence, adding a so-called calibration function (CF) Gσ with Gσ (r) dr = 0 (6) to either of the two exchange energy densities to consider the potential mismatch between their gauge origins is necessary. While introducing a CF has no effect on GH and RSH functionals, a local admixture as in LH and LRSLH functionals gives the additional non-vanishing energy term",

The decrease in G IC under mode I static loading began when M n = 18 kg/mol regardless of temperature. According to the authors, this behavior was seen before in earlier work related to neat polypropylene. This value is also close to other semi-crystalline polymers like PET or PA11.

  "It is shown that excitation of these methylated DBT derivatives at 320 nm populates their lowest-energy singlet (S1) state directly, which relaxes with lifetimes ranging from ca. 4 ± 1 in acetonitrile to ca. 13 ± 1 ps in cyclohexane. As relaxation in the S1 (ππ*) surface occurs, most of the population undergoes efficient (ca. 98%) intersystem crossing (ISC) to a ππ* triplet state with a relatively short lifetime ranging from 820 ± 50 to 900 ± 30 ps. Notably, the experimental results seem to challenge the El-Sayed propensity rules for ISC to the triplet manifold. However, linear interpolation of internal coordinates (LIIC) calculations between two minima located in the S1 potential energy surface (PES) reveal a reasonable chemical basis for relaxing the spin-forbidden ISC propensity rules and provides guidelines for future molecular designs to exploit this process.",

The source of the hydrogen in the hydrosilane product 8 also remained unexplained. It was not a result of abstraction from the side groups, since no other silicon containing products were observed in the reaction mixture.",
  "Focusing on the micro scale, studies typically use forced input temperatures or concentrations of the reactants to observe the kinetic processes at the catalyst surface by measuring the transient response via mass spectrometry (MS) . There are different input signals and several experimental techniques available to evaluate the dynamic processes of a reaction system, which usually use ramp, step and periodic changes of a state variable with time .",
  "Several operational constraints exist at the test facility. METEC was initially developed to evaluate leak detection systems in the ARPA-E MONITOR program, targeting relatively low emission rates observed from fugitive component leaks in eld studies. As noted above, emission rates were varied to sweep, as best possible, across the full range of every solution's probability of detection (POD) curve. In general, this required larger gas releases and gas supply than was available from the installed capacity at METEC. Therefore, while the rst test period used the CNG supply at METEC, a CNG trailer with larger capacity was connected to the METEC gas supply system during the 2022 testing period to support longer and larger releases, and more continuous operation.",
  "1) The most important contribution of our approach to improving reactivity prediction is the introduction of the molecular ratios into the new embedding layer. The knowledge of the molar ratio between reagents and the limiting reactant enables a more fundamental chemical differentiation with respect to learning the reactivity of a reaction. 2) One of the limitations introduced by the SMILES representation is that molecule separators \".\"",
  "The design of spin crossover complexes. Vennelakanti and co-workers recently curated a set of 95 experimentally validated spin crossover (SCO) complexes, SCO-95, from which we extracted 47 Fe (II) SCO complexes (SCO_47) with diverse coordination types (Table ). And 615 samples were obtained by masking ligands from partially to totally in these 47 complexes. Depending on CNg, each sample may have multiple variations to generate. Totally 2,469 variations were obtained from these 615 samples. And for each of them, we assigned the size of each generated ligand to be 10 heavy atoms or less. Finally, the model generated 2,231 valid complexes. We then added hydrogen atoms back to each valid complex and calculated the total charge of each compound.",
  "X-ray experiments were conducted at sector 15-ID-C (NSF's ChemMatCARS) of the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory. We collected XR and XFNTR data using an incident x-ray energy of 18.3 keV. Two motorized slits set the incident beam size to 2 mm horizontally and 0.02 mm vertically. XR signal was detected on a Pilatus 200 K area detector. A Vortex-60EX multi cathode energy dispersive x-ray detector, placed perpendicularly 10 mm above the liquid surface, recorded fluorescence signal. Films were prepared on a Langmuir trough inside a chamber, which was purged with He to reduce background scattering and beam damage.",
  "They also report that the nπ * is the lowest in energy in the nonplanar geometry and is, in principle, accessible from the La state through a relatively small activation barrier of 0.15 eV, although they exclude this process because of the amplitude of the wavepacket propagating at this direction is considered to be small.",
  "When evaluating MOF structures, our rules are more comprehensive. The system checks if the answer correctly identifies the metal center, organic linkers, and their connectivity. We also assess descriptions of porosity and specific surface area, as well as the identification and explanation of the MOF's main functions. To encourage more in-depth answers, we provide extra points for mentioning synthesis methods and characterization techniques.",

  "The worse fit of the multireference result to the experimental E/Z ratio could be a result of methodological inconsistency, as the single point energies were computed on DFT geometries. But as the activation energy of the first step is reproduced better with this hybrid approach than with DFT only, it is also possible that the DFT TST results cross over with the experimental value on accident.",
  "None of the samples showed any significant diffractions before the catalytic activity tests, pointing to the XRD-amorphous character of the prepared NF catalysts (Figure ). Apparently, copper-containing particles formed during calcination were too small and their content too low to be observed in PXRD. The formation of small nanoparticles, as was observed by STEM on the surface of the calcined sample DI-1.8 (Chyba!

  "Comparing the docking poses of 5a and FT895 (Figure ) shows that the benzohydroxamate moiety of 5a is inserted deeper in the binding pocket allowing for one terminal phenyl ring to be sandwiched between the side chains of Tyr209 and Leu268 with which it forms hydrophobic interactions, while the other phenyl ring attached to the pyrazole nitrogen is directed towards loop 1 and forming hydrophobic interactions with Pro36 thus fulfilling the aim of the design.",
  "A solution to this conundrum was offered by testing the stability of the used restricted Kohn-Sham (KS) wavefunction. We found out that the RB3LYP functional tends to break the spin symmetry imposed on the spin-orbitals in this case. After identifying the RKS→UKS instability and reoptimizing the KS wavefunction and the molecular geometry, a different picture about the aromaticity of [5,7]HPP 2+ emerged (Figure ). The direction of the induced global ring current changed to paratropic. Therefore, the calculations suggest that Möbius [5,7]HPP 2+ is, in fact, an antiaromatic compound.",
  "The addition of a hydrogen-atom donor, which is required in related methods, had a limited impact in present case (entry 9). The yield of 1 was lower in the presence of g-terpinene, which is a strong donor thanks to its low bond dissociation energy (BDE), and it rose slightly adding diphenylmethane or HCO2Na (vide infra for a rationale).",
  "The electron transfer between substrate and electrode is facilitated by the use of such mediators, thus also influence the selectivity of the electrosynthetic methodology. As both the mediators and supporting electrolyte represent an expense factor and source of waste, therefore for industrial applications their reuse and recovery in terms of various cycle is highly demanded.",
  "Consequently, the quenching of the fluorescent signal is dominant over the increase in fluorescence signal. Eventually the signal stabilises, suggesting that the aggregation changes are too weak to be detected with this instrument. Both structures contribute to the total fluorescence yield in the ThT assay, which averages signals across the well. This explains the fluorescence detected from the start (Fig. .A), as sonication appears to initiate aggregation and form large fluorescent complexes. These results confirm NACore segment aggregation under our experimental MS-compatible conditions, as fluorescence detection indicates βsheet presence. Additionally, they establish a timeline for small, soluble oligomers in IM-MS, expected between the lag phase and plateau, approximately 2.5 hours post-dissolution.",
  "The error in the inter-molecular energy of the 7:3 M liquid state (s ≈ 1) is reduced by about 50 meV atom -1 , however adding isolated molecules is not sufficient to fix this problem. In Gen6+IM/DS we further extend the training set by adding configurations across the full range of molecular compositions. As shown in figure , this new model performs significantly better and volume scan energy predictions at s ≈ 1 are within a few meV atom -1 of the DFT values. Importantly, GAP-MD trajectories obtained with models above Gen6/DS are stable at all compositions (figure ).",
  "We previously reported STEpo epothilones designed to use a stilbene photoswitch to light-dependently control bioactivity, by Zisomer-dependently forming a key hydrogen bond (from the thiazole nitrogen to Thr274 on tubulin, which stabilises an M-loop that in turn makes a lateral contact stabilising the MT lattice). Those STEpo were accessed in low yield by Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons (HWE) olefinations of a synthetically accessible epothilone methyl ketone. Now, we intended to attach thiazoloazobenzene photoswitches to the epothilone instead, to achieve AzoEpo reagents that should be bidirectionally photoswitchable between Z-and E-rich PSSs. Although thiazolo-azobenzenes underwent smooth HWE, Wittig and Julia-Kociensky olefinations with model aldehydes, only decomposition products resulted from reactions with ketones including the target epothilone methyl ketone. Poor to zero yields were likewise obtained for olefin metathesis reactions between thiazolo azobenzenes and model substrates (Figures and Supporting Note 2), leading us to abandon this approach once the success of the epothilone photocaging strategy became apparent.",
  "To complement the incomplete picture emerging from the static view provided by a QTAIM analysis, a molecular dynamics (MD) approach might be suitable. Such an approach could use the ensemble of BCPs sampled from an MD trajectory of a protein-ligand complex, aiming to capture a physically more meaningful representation of the binding event. Specifics of the graph-construction process (\"through-time\" edges or other aggregation strategies) and whether such a strategy potentially provides benefits over a corresponding atom-centered view remain as questions for future work. An opportunity lies in the exploration of predicted (rather than calculated) electron densities using deep models trained on ab initio calculations.",

  "(2) Effective reaction molecularities are particularly important to understand the steps in dichalcogenide exchange sequences. For example: thiol addition onto trans-fused dichalcogenides is almost irreversible (very low kT-1), which makes SeST reduction by monothiols a quasi-bimolecular process, with its rate approaching that for activating regiocontrol SSeC that can undergo true bimolecular activation. Yet, when using vicinal dithiol reductants, the second step in reduction is unimolecular and thiol cycling at Se is no longer rate-limiting (due to vicinal dithiol preorganisation): so SeST is unprecedently dithiol-labile, while SSeC is no more labile than the TrxR probe SeSC.",
  "To simulate PESs, the initial wave packets were assumed to arise from a vertical transition from the anion, in accord with the Condon approximation. The wave functions for the (rotationless) 00, 51, and 11 anion vibrational states were obtained by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian in Equation 2 using the Lanczos method. Wave packets were propagated along the neutral potential energy surface, developed by Han et al. using the same PIP-NN method.",
  "All initial coordinates of non-hydrogen atoms were taken from 6RGP record of Protein Data Bank . The 6RGP structure was solved at subatomic resolution (0.97 Å) and presents clearly distinguishable oxidized and reduced enzyme forms (Fig. ). To model the proton transfers, the QM calculations included TNC's adjacent environment in gas phase. Such an approach is possible due to the fact that the TNC is immersed into hydrophobic core of the laccase macromolecule. In all models there were included three TNC copper ions and side chains of eight histidine residues coordinating them.",
  "Through testing on number of benchmark datasets to evaluate binding free energies using the Generalized Born Surface Area (GBSA) method, we have identified default parameters: employing a dielectric constant of 4 and disregarding the entropy term. The exclusion of the entropy term was recommended due to its marginal impact on enhancing ranking performance, while imposing a computational burden.",
  "Before the production runs, energy minimization of the systems was implemented to optimize the separation between the molecules and atoms, after having placed them in the initial containment boxes. This was done using the steepest descent method. The simulations were performed in an NPT-ensemble with temperature 310 K and pressure 1 atm with velocity-rescale 60 thermostat and Berendsen barostat. The compressibility was 4.5 • 10 -5 bar -1 . The cut-off scheme was Verlet 62 with the type van der Walls and a radius of 0.9 nm. The cutoff distances of 0.9 nm were applied for the Coulumb, Lennard-Jones and short-range neighbor interactions. Particle Mesh Ewald algorithm with a Fourier spacing of 0.12 nm 63 was applied for long-range electrostatics. The simulations were run for 300 ns in total, using a time step of 2 fs.

  "The terbutryn degradation pathway shown in Figure (d), suggests the triazine ring did not encounter OH radical attack and remains unchanged. We confirmed it after analysis of its fragment pattern which was also previously observed by Luft et al., . The Sulphur group in terbutryn is a prominent nucleophilic center of the compounds which was assumed to form the sulfonyl of sulfoxides compounds. In contrast, the toxicity levels of terbuthylazine TPs were lowered to its parent compound. However, the concentration of sulfamethoxazole TPs detected was in ngL -1 (three magnitudes lower than the threshold values) and likewise, higher amounts of initial micropollutants were used to detect measurable TPs peaks in LC-MS, we conclude that the Fe(0) Fenton reaction catalyzed by iron powder efficiently degrade micropollutants consists of antimicrobial activity and produce low-risk oxidized products which were suggested to have reduced hazard to aquatic organisms.",
  "Further studies involving more precise diffraction methods are necessary to probe this phase in more detail. As recently discussed by Huang et al. for the related MA 0.13 EA 0.87 PbBr 3 perovskite, the disappearance of the low-temperature phase transition may be also related to the tolerance factor approaching unity upon mixing, which prevents large octahedral tilts associated with the orthorhombic P nma phase. Upon further increase of x, we observed phase separation indicating that the EA solubility limit in MAPbI 3 is about 40%.",

  "The unusual reactivity of this system compelled deeper investigation (Scheme 4). Firstly, support for the formation of the expected alkyl radical from the precursor NHPI ester was achieved by using radical clock NHPIs (Scheme 4a). Under standard conditions, use of alkene substituted NHPI 57 delivered a ca. 1:3 mixture of 58 and ring closed analogue 59. Likewise, cyclopropyl NHPI 60 led exclusively to ring opened product 20. Addition of TEMPO to the standard reaction completely inhibited the reaction (Scheme 4b). Greater insight was found in the reactivity profiles of the organoboron component (Scheme 4c).",

  "Considering that the current method of polarity classification using formulaic representation of RGB channels does not adequately represent Stokes shift, the HSV (Hue/Saturation/Value) color space was used. This mathematically equivalent and comparable HSV color space represents color by its hue on a 360° color wheel, saturation (%), and value (%). Its independent relationship between hue and value, provides classification of fluorescence color with more definitive characteristics for categorization .",
  "However, much work remains to make LASSI and LAS-PDFT convincing alternatives to standard DFT approaches. Firstly, there is a pressing need to develop a periodic implementation of the LAS method in order increase efficiency and enable applications to threedimensional systems. This task requires solving the CI problem in each fragment during a LAS cycle and thus requires more than just a transform of the integrals to reciprocal space. Work in this direction is ongoing. Additionally, the selection and optimization of active spaces in larger basis sets and periodic systems may prove challenging. Here, automated active space selection schemes and embedding theories 58 may have a role to play.",
  "Both pathways lead to the formation of Li-Cl structures at the surface while oxygen penetrates deeper into the lithium metal, creating structures that locally resemble oxide configurations (Fig. ) . The formed Li-Cl structures loosely resemble a Li 3 Cl(100) surface, with the nearest neighbor distance of Cl atoms averaging at about 4 Å. We also performed AIMD runs with two additional perchlorate moities per unit cell (Fig. ). Even for this higher perchlorate concentration, a complete separation into chloride surface and oxide subsurface structures occurred.",

  "To assess the aromatic character of the benzenoid ring in tripak at different valence states with even number of electrons the nucleus-independent chemical shift (NICS) at 1Å above the centroid of the ring was calculated. Noticeable negative and positive NICS values identify potentially aromatic and antiaromatic rings, respectively. To confirm that the magnetic shielding probed by NICS is not affected by local currents from the surrounding lone pairs but is associated with cyclic delocalization of electrons, and hence aromaticity, the electron density of delocalized bonds (EDDB) was used. NICS(1) values and EDDB isosufrace contours together with the relative singlet-triplet energy gaps are presented in Figure .",

  "The behavior of the brominated compounds is rather different. For instance, 5f bbz EP is not rotationally locked when compared to its iodinated counterpart (Figure ) and can adopt a wide range of favorable (< 2 RT) membrane insertions and orientations. Hence, the XB probability (CO-type) along the insertion (Figure ) decreases less markedly and XBs can be found until very deep membrane insertions. For bbz EP , a well-defined minimum with the C-Br vector oriented towards the lipid tails and larger insertions is observed and, consequently, the XB probabilities decay very fast with membrane insertion, similarly to what was observed for iphen EP .",

  "The R-Trap is a rectilinear RF quadrupole ion trap capable of pulsed orthogonal extraction through an exit slot cut into the topmost trapping electrode. Supplemental Figure shows a diagram of the electrode structure and applied potentials, as well as a photograph of one such device. Ions were injected through a terminal aperture into the 2 mm inscribed radius RF channel. 3 MHz RF potential at up to 2000 Vpeak-peak was applied to the trapping electrodes to generate the radial pseudopotential well. One set of trapping electrodes were split, creating a space in which an additional pair of DC only auxiliary trapping electrodes were mounted . With -7 V applied, these electrodes protruded at the axial centerline, generating an axial trapping well underneath the extraction slot. Prior to extraction, the trap was lifted to a high +2.5 kV potential and then the 400 V push/pull extraction potential applied causing ions to be ejected into the injection assembly.

  "In conclusion, we have synthesised and characterised a novel mixed valency ion doped vacancy-ordered triple perovskite, Sn: Cs3Bi2Br9, which expands the structural and compositional space of Class II Robin-Day compounds. The material features broadband absorption which, through supporting calculations, we ascribe to an inter-valence charge transfer transition. We also identify possible intermediate band transitions involving the band edges and Sn based states within the band gap. Powder samples are stable in air for long periods, which may be due to surface effects alongside the enhanced stability of the Sn(II) ion conferred by the stabilising electronic and elastic interactions associated with the double substitution. Uniquely among the previously studied mixed valence metal halides, we find the mixed valence dopants prefer to associate in an electrically neutral defect complex, and this leads to differences in the evolution of the IVCT band compared with classical materials such as Cs2Sn1-xSbxCl6. While we speculate that the IVCT absorption itself may not produce extractable charge carriers, the associated intermediate band transitions may be able to do so, and this could be a topic for further study to assess the photovoltaic potential of such materials.",
  "In a variation of method 3 applied for P207-C120 synthesis design, cyclization may take place between two unequally sized pieces, 23b and 24, prepared through benzyne trimerization (Scheme 9). It might be possible to make P207-C120 unit cell in one-pot reaction starting from trimer 24, or even monomer 21. Schemes 8-9 both imply C7 rings formation only during the step of joining unit cells. Octagons too can be combined in trimers and spaced out at the four diagonal corners of the cube totaling twelve heptagons in the unit cell according to Euler's formula. C2 Fragments added between unit cells of P221-C120 (shown in red, Fig. ) must stay on just three faces of the cube making unsymmetrical chambers difficult but still possible to synthesize (Scheme 10). A plan of complexity 3 suggests joining three dimers 25 into the first cycle of six octagons, then adding two nonequal size trimers as top and bottom covers. The last three octagons result from adding the small cover, 28. Another way for dealing with unsymmetrical chambers is to make one larger than the unit cell (Scheme 11). Four dimers 30 create a barrel, 33. Three barrels join through benzyne trimerization into halfchamber. Two half-chambers join into small chamber 35 serving as the periodic super-element and easing off TSK limitations. Tilings",

  "The cathode interface resistance (R2) and diffusion components are plotted as a function of cycle number for charge (Figure ) and discharge (Figure ). The shrinking, in the discharge spectra, of the interface and diffusion impedances over time-most dramatically over early cycles-is attributable to the growth of active/accessible area, in agreement with the increasing cycle capacity that was observed (Figure ) due to expansion of the product surface coverage. Deposition and recovery of the less-accessible product populations eventually approaches a balance between discharge and charge phases. These effects could likely be circumvented with finer current collector dimensions.",

  "While the force and stress predictions also improved compared to the conventional training on DFT Ref data, the errors remain substantial. This suggests that although the pre-trained model contains information about the Tens configurations from empirical potentials, the predictions were not automatically corrected during the transfer learning when corresponding DFT data were missing, highlighting the challenge to design dataset for transferable NNPs. In other word, even pre-trained model can perfectly predict any case of configurations of the empirical potentials, the selection of data to relabel with DFT is crucial. As we observed in empirical potential cases, as the model becomes more robust and transferable, the total energy accuracy can decrease.",
  "For all models generated in this work, the curve for the number of novel discoveries eventually flattens. In other words, the models display a limited capacity for generating unique samples, which is unsurprising since the number of possible Elpasolites is also limited. Notably, the rediscoveries constitute a low share throughout, so that the model clearly does more than mere trainingset memorization. Since repetitions begin to dominate the generation procedure after 10,000 samples, we terminate the generation procedure at this point for all further analyses of minority class generation.",

  "Control reactions that omitted the disulfide co-catalyst (TRIPS)₂ led us to investigate the origin of productive conversion, despite the absence of an obvious hydrogen atom donor (Table &). Given prior reports of formal hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) radical cyclizations proceeding via chain mechanisms, we deemed it prudent to examine whether such a process was contributing to our reaction. In this mechanism, a primary carbon-centered radical (VI) could abstract a hydrogen atom from the αposition of substrate 1a, producing ketolactone 2a along with a new radical (V). This hypothesis suggests that the photoredox cycle might primarily serve as an initiator for a radical chain, with limited involvement from a closed multicatalytic cycle (Figure ).",

After about 500 ns, the system overcomes a sharp transition from the L 1 to the L 2 basin, which is associated with a change in A-1 puckering, the rupture of some of the key HBs characteristic of the L 1 basin, and the formation of a new H-bond pattern typical of the L 2 basin (Figure ).",
  "The Brillouin zone was sampled with (2 × 2 × 1) Monkhorst-Pack k-point grids . The calculations were spin-polarised, and no symmetry constraints were imposed.

  "In Section 2, an analytical exact formula will be presented which enables to express the tunneling current (I) mediated by a single level at any temperature and bias in terms of digamma functions of complex argument. Based on that formula, we will show that I can indeed vary over several orders of magnitudes (Section 4), making discrimination between tunneling and hopping a challenging matter (see Conclusion). We will also deduce analytical formulas for the current expressed in terms of elementary functions valid in the low and high temperature limits (Section 3); they turn out to be very accurate in very broad model parameter ranges (Section 5), complementary covering virtually all situations of interest for real molecular junctions.",
  "Additional support was provided for this hypothesis by examining the resulting loaded PS with USPIONs not coated by PLA. TEM images served as the primary source of confirmation; images portrayed generally circular vesicles with sizes in agreement with DLS, with interior dark rings representing electron density in the membrane due to IO packing. The rings were singular in these PSs, however (Figure ). A thermodynamic explanation having to do with the hydrophilic fraction is likely involved, but it is most obvious to us that the phenomenon is in line with the hypothesis from Krack the PLA-USPIONs, much bulkier than uncoated USPIONs, made it more difficult for the hydrophobic layer to become completely sealed off from hydrophilic spaces, motivating the formation of additional layers.",
  "Finally, as in prior test programs, release rates did not span the range necessary for many solutions to achieve 90% DL within the tested range. Comparing the three release programs to recently approved EPA regulations shows that there is a need for future programs to test above the survey mode requirements listed in EPA's subpart OOOOb of 15 kg/h. Also, field testing indicates a need for future testing to include non-fugitive emission sources during controlled release testing. Revisions of the controlled testing protocol, currently underway, will address these two issues.",

  "Each platform type was being developed within the chemputation roadmap concurrently, so they overlap chronologically; however, each category is described in its own timeline for clarity. N.B. in some cases publishing happened later than when the practical work was completed, thus each section describes systems development chronologically rather than a publication timeline. Also there have been several examples of standalone projects and automated systems developed in the group for a singular function/idea and don't quite fit into the four central categories. Examples include crystal formation to produce random numbers , synthesis of biological-inorganic peptide strutures 17 , using machine learning to explore sequence space for antimicrobial peptide discovery and pinning humans against algorithms in a competition to discover and crystallize giant polyoxometalates to name a few. Closed loop systems that can perform chemical reactions, analyse outcomes, and infer from the results the best next step toward a target goal is both the most difficult and most soughtafter processes to achieve.

The approximate transition state obtained with the GSM is fully optimized using the RS-P-RFO algorithm as implemented in Pysisyphus.

Spurious transition states are thus identified and filtered.",

  "One implication from these analyses is that the photon energy stored temporary in the electronically excited state of the photocatalyst must be divided to drive oxidation and reduction half reaction. Another implication is that decreasing the Eg of photocatalysts allows using photons with longer wavelength to access its electronically-excited state. However, it unavoidably results in decrease of its oxidation and/or reduction power -positions of frontier orbitals (or band edges) shift towards ~0 V. Given that i) the reagents employed in photocatalytic dehydrogenation reactions are characterized by oxidation potential > 1.5 V vs. SCE and ii) the necessity to create driving force for H + reduction to H2, until now mainly photocatalysts with Eg > 2.5 eV were successfully employed (Figure ).",

  "For this purpose, we tailored a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) for NIR signals (>800 nm) and employed time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC).

Their fluorescence lifetime (> 900 nm) follows a biexponential decay and the longer lifetime component (370 ps) changes with dopamine concentration. It increases by up to 25 % with detection limits in the nM range. These sensors serve as paint to cover cells and report extracellular dopamine in 3D via FLIM. We therefore show the potential of using fluorescence lifetime in combination with confocal microscopy as readout for SWCNT-based sensors.",

The projector augmented-wave (PAW) method was used to represent the core electrons, treating Bi 5d 10 6s 2 6p 3 , Sn 4d 10 5s 2 5p 2 and O 2s 2 2p 4 as valence states. Convergence testing using the primitive cell of α-Bi 2 Sn 2 O 7 (44 atoms) suggested that a Γ-centered 3×3×2 k-point mesh and 500 eV plane-wave kinetic-energy cutoff were sufficient to converge the total energy to within 1 meV per atom and 3 meV per atom respectively (Figure ). For the geometry optimisations the cutoff energy was increased to 650 eV to avoid Pulay stress, and the optimisation was deemed converged when the residual Hellmann-Feynman forces acting on the atoms were less than 10 -4 eV/Å.",
  "The k-vector integration in these calculations was carried out using Lebedev quadrature. We note that calculations with the default grid of order 5 yield partial widths that break symmetryimposed constraints. Hence, we computed the resonant Auger spectrum of benzene with a tighter integration grid of order 17; the difference between the spectra obtained with the two grids is shown in the SI.

  "The observation that protons on the aand b-carbon contribute to the stability of the pseudorotaxane is clear; the explanation is less obvious. The crystal structures are all disordered, and this must be borne in mind when short contacts are considered as evidence for weak interactions. Taking Pr2NH2•1 as a representative case: we considered whether the H-atoms on the a-, band γ-carbons could make short contacts to electronegative atoms, producing weak C-H•••X hydrogen bonds. We discuss the C….X distances below, without making assumptions of the positions of the H-atoms.",
  "In the present work, we have explored whether there exists any trend among the ligands that are metabolized by LinB and DhaA haloalkane dehalogenases with respect to the ratelimiting step of the overall catalyzed reaction by these two HLDs.

  "In this regard, it is interesting to analyze DELs by the number of BBs incorporated in the final compounds on the µGTM landscape and spot, at a glance, how 2BB and 3BB libraries cohabitate (or not) in CLS, and how they are positioned with respect to a reference library. The µGTM landscapes are created by coloring the map by property value (here -#BB) of each item (here: the DEL, defined by its responsibility vector) on the map (see Figure ). Since in the current work, #BB may be only 2 or 3, these landscapes are nothing but fuzzy two-class landscapes (compare to previous \"top100\" versus other DELs), where CLS zones occupied by only 2BB or respectively 3BB libraries adopt \"extreme\" colors and zones witnessing a coexistence of the two types of DELs translate the relative population onto the provided color spectrum. Overall, out of 2497 DELs: 77 are 2BB-and 2420 are 3BB-libraries.",

  "Later mechanistic studies suggested that dissociation of Pd precatalysts to the active monoligated Pd(0) species and the subsequent Pd(0) OA to ArCl is the ratedetermining step . This suggests that further enhancement of OA rate would allow for an even faster reaction in the aryl chloride-involved coupling reactions. The likely formation of Pd(0)(XPhos)(ArCl) precomplex as a neutral intermediate by Grimand and a proposed concerted three-centered mechanism supported by the Hammett study of OA of ArCl to the XPhosPd(0) complex by Buchwald 128 , indicates that our current approach focusing on Pd(0)-Cl (ArCl) interaction is suitable for further investigation of the mystery molecular mechanism in efficient OA of ArCl not limited on the donor ability of the ligand.

This result indicates that close connection, which eventually, gives rise to more junctions within the network is essential for enhanced conductivity, with the more closed network showing the least resistance and the sparsely formed network showing the highest resistance. To understand the phenomena occurring on the electrode surface, the DC current-voltage dependence was investigated by imposing across the two electrode terminals a staircase potential difference between 0 and 2 V with a 20-mV step, Figure .

  "On Au(111), for example, thiol-induced reconstruction is associated with formation of atomic vacancies (VAu) and corresponding gold adatom-thiolate complexes ((RS)x-Auad, x = 1 -4), where the Auad species is generally bonded to threefold hollow sites on the underlying Au(111) substrate. Increasing coverage (θ) of the thiol promotes increasing degrees of surface reconstruction. For linear alkanethiolate-based SAMs, (RS)2-Auad species are mainly formed, with a thiolate saturation surface coverage of 0.33. This requires an Auad coverage of 0.16, which may mainly be provided by removal from step edges, but also by the uptake of Au surface atoms from terraces or uplifted islands/defects, depending on the location and mechanism of thiolate adsorption. Atomic vacancies (VAu, θvac ≈ 0.12) can later coalesce to form vacancy islands at terraces or diffuse to yield serration-like steps. A more complex dynamic is observed for thiols with terminal groups distinct from alkyl.",

  "The efficacy of relative RBFE is often limited by sampling and overlap. The former poses a challenge because of the extremely large conformational space of ligand-protein complexes, which can require MD simulations of up to microseconds for effective sampling.

  "The styrene-TMA dissociation curves show the opposite trend in that all TD-DFT methods over-bind this exciplex. This overbinding can be attributed to strongly redshifted excitations at the minimum which is a CT excitation, whereas this redshift is less pronounced or becomes a blueshift at the endpoint which has a localised excitation. This imbalance leads to an artificially lowered minimum in the interaction energy curves due to the total energies of the minimum structures being too low and the interaction energies being the differences between total energies. Examples for select DFA are shown in Table . GGA methods, which show the most pronounced over-binding and the largest redshifts near the minima at 3 Å, underestimate SCS-CC2/def2-QZVP energies by about 2 eV.

  "The high-energy areas contain chemically unreasonable structures, for instance, those with a deeply unfavorable isolated Cl -in vacuum (zone A) or H2 and HCl formation from the catalyst decomposition (zone C), or an hypervalent P with trigonal bipyramidal shape (zone B), or even displaying a C-C dissociation (zone D), see Figure . The class landscapes for alkanes/alkenes presence and their coordination states shown on Figure exhibit remarkable discriminatory power, partitioning the GTM into three distinct region featuring uncoordinated ethylene or ethane (the upper left and upper right areas, respectively) and species with coordination of at least one carbon atom to the metal (bottom area). This suggest that GTM inherently produced a chemically meaningful mapping, that can be used for a chemical feature-based characterizations. As an example, here, by projecting and following each reaction step on the class landscapes of Figure , it appears clearly that the reaction starts with a free ethylene, then proceeds to its coordination and hydrogenation (while still being coordinated), followed finally by the release of a free ethane. With the appropriate class landscapes, a similar analysis could be performed based on any chemically relevant feature/property (e.g., the oxidation state of Rh or partial atomic charges on selected atoms).",
  "«Dear Frank,… preprints are particularly purposeful in chemistry, because most chemistry papers describe either new synthetic or new analytical methods. Thanks to preprint publishing, chemists who discovered said new methods immediately establish priority at no economic cost. A very important need, especially for chemists reporting new findings from peripheral countries. As we wrote in our preprint subsequently published as peer reviewed study by ACS Omega: 'Another key advantage for authors is that they are able to claim priority on new ideas in preprints. Such postings should help authors avoid having unethical referees take ideas and claim them for their own, an issue lamented by several authors and a known misconduct for which the Committee on Publication Ethics… has published guidelines already in 2010. However intolerable, this practice continues to occur even when submitting to high-impact-factor journals in all sort of disciplines including medicine, and not only to scientists in their early career, as Noble Prize Lipscomb remarked several years ago: 'I no longer put my most original ideas in my research proposals, which are read by many referees and officials. I hold back anything that another investigator might hop on and carry out. When I was starting out, people respected each other's research more than they do today, and there was less stealing of ideas' ».",
  "In summary, when trained on a complete dataset, we observed strong mutual agreement in the molecular dynamics of the alanine tetrapeptide generated by MACE and SO3krates models. Discrepancies arise when the training datasets lack either folded or unfolded geometries. Both models reasonably explored the unfolded PES basin when trained on the unfolded dataset. The MACE folded model is consistent with the complete one. The SO3krates folded and unfolded models were mostly consistent, while the sGDML MLFFs demonstrated increased sensitivity to variations in the training data.",

For a more in depth description of the method, we direct the reader to Reference 7 as well as the original block diagonalisation diabatisation papers of Pacher, Köppel and Cederbaum . In the following, where appropriate, the geometry dependence of the electronic states will be explicitly referenced, with R used to denote the vector of nuclear coordinates.",

At that time, ∆H fus does not reach equilibrium, but rather rises from 67 to 81 J/g after 240 days of aging, showcased in Figure . This increase is originating from thermal annealing according to the authors.",
  "While the exact distribution of dopants in the surface cannot be controlled during the growth process, if the growth is driven by thermodynamics a structure like the one seen in the Ru 50-10 would be obtained. Other 50% distributions have also shown promising results (see T = 0K and 500 K MD results in Figures S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information) so that the exact distribution should not affect the Cu growth to the point where island formation is promoted over a 2D morphology.",
  "These procedures make the influence of screening thresholds on calculation times hardly predictable and might actually increase the calculation time for larger thresholds. Thus, we decided to set the threshold for screening integrals building G j to 10 -14 and make the screening threshold not changeable for the user. The thresholds were chosen such that the differences in the Fock contribution, amplitudes and gradient contribution were below 10 -12 a.u. compared to the original implementation for our test cases of H 2 , H 2 O and LiH at a pressure of 50 GP a with a scaling factor of the atomic VDW radii of 1.2 and 302 tesserae per atom. To asses the impact of our integral screening and the chosen thresholds, we measured the timing for the calculation of the GOSTSHYP matrices of n-dodecane, where the calculation time was reduced from 60.3 s to 25.3 s, when running on one thread.",
  "It has bound to it one of the original terminal -OH, one terminal -OH that comes from the bridge bond-breaking events and two bridging Al-OH (shown in Fig. ). As the metaD simulation continues, the last two bridging bonds both break from the surface side which leaves two hydroxyls attached to the monomer such that the dissolved monomer is tetrahedral Al(OH) - 4 (Fig. (c) and (d). This pathway leaves one 4-coordinated and one 5-coordinated Al at the edge when the monomer is detached.",
  "Polymer functionalization can integrate stimuli-responsivity, improving CA performance upon pathologic exposure. Solubilityswitching polymers have been applied to directly enhance CA-water interactions or cause CA aggregation . Polymeric encapsulation has also been used to shield CAs from aqueous exposure temporarily(4), muting contrast in neutral conditions. Here, we have developed an acid and enzymeresponsive iron oxide (IO) CA through polymersome (PS) encapsulation. Although IO CAs are not predisposed to stimuli-responsive activity, polymer functionalization has been able to induce tuneable, stimuli-triggered relaxivity changes . PSs, nanoparticle vesicles formed from the self-assembly of amphiphilic block co-polymers, can coencapsulate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs , which could enable the future addition of therapeutics alongside IO CAs.",
  "For most molecules with heavy atoms and significantly large electronic SOC matrix elements (from ~10 cm -1 ) between the involved electronic states, Eq. ( ) provides rather accurate results. However, many organic molecules presenting negligible electronic SOCs still show significant ISC. In these cases, the ISC is driven by the coupling of electronic SOCs with the vibrational degrees of freedom. Analogously to fluorescence, an HT-like expression also exists for ISC and has been implemented in dedicated codes for excited state rate calculations. In the latter expression, the electronic SOC operator additionally includes the first-order term of the tailor expansion in 𝑄 7 , i.e., the vibronic spin-orbit interaction: 34",
  "Paraffin and Silicone oil were used as the dispersed phase as before. The liquid pool was confined between two parallel plates as in figure . At the unconfined state, with 100 μm h  , the dispersed droplets assumed core-shell morphology (figure ); and it didn't alter to Janus as the confinement was increased, e.g. h decreased to ~45 μm , it continued to remain core- shell (figure ). Thus, this observation corroborates with earlier observation that presence of micelles dominates over the effect of confinement and as a result, in spite of decrease in pressure within the bulk liquid, driven by its confinement, desorption of surfactant molecules does not happen from the SA interface; and the interfacial energy too doesn't alter.",
  "Alan Turing was the first to mention this phenomenon in his private correspondence with his colleague Robin Grandy dated 1954 2 : Turing pointed out this paradoxical result. Frequent measurements can slow the evolution of a quantum system, hindering transitions to states different from the initial one . This phenomenon is considered related to the quadratic behaviour of the survival probability at short times for the Schrödinger equation , as pointed out by John von Neumann . Degasperis, Fonda and Ghirardi carried out the first approach to the phenomenon, while Baidyanath Misra and George Sudarshan 1 developed its rigorous description.",
  "The stretching-speed dependency of mechanical properties (Fig. ) could also been explained by the spring model. Under a sudden stretch, advanced structures didn't have time to deform and behaved more like a rigid body (increased effective k3), which reached a great peak stress at low strains. Keep extending the material led to the damage of a great portion of advanced structures (effective k 3 dropped), resulting in reduced stress. When a low stretching speed was employed, the advanced structures were given enough time to change their shapes and absorb energy. Therefore, they behave more like normal springs and helped achieve a higher elasticity.",
  "Equation 10 provides key insight into observing inductive effects due to the interaction between both competing processes. Terms with the chemical potential gradient (∇μ) describe phase boundary stabilization diffusion and the source term 1 dp ĵINT describes (de)intercalation. When LFP material is relaxed inside miscibility gap (presented cases for lithiation levels from 0.2 to 0.8 in Figure )) it phase separates. Application of external flux to the phase separated LFP state, result in (de)intercalation source term 1 dp ĵINT that is not constant across the whole domain but rather governed by in-homogeneous concentration field. This produces chemical potential gradients in the system and slow diffusion of lithium across the domain that stabilizes phase boundaries follows as a direct consequence of fast destabilizing (de)intercalation process. These processes explain the occurrence of inductive effect in the low part of spectrum for LFP inside miscibility gap. This observation can also be confirmed by the fact that system of equations 9 and 10 satisfy mathematical condition for chemical inductor postulated in for lithiation levels within the miscibility gap.",
  "Next, we modified a model from Sun and Goldys 37 to allow estimation of the excitonic peak extinction coefficients and peak widths as a function of lateral plate size. The original model assumed a gaussian distribution of plate sizes centered on L and with width σ L .

  "A graph-based energetic span analysis can provide estimates for turnover frequencies to compare the competing mechanisms. Analysing the catalytic cycle as a whole allows us to identify the TOF-determining intermediates and transition states. The results support the RWGS route being the main CTM pathway. This can be explained by smaller reaction barriers along the RWGS mechanisms.",
  "where w i denotes the mass fraction of component i and T g,i is the glass transition temperature for i as a pure substance. Eq. ( ) presumes uniform and ideal mixing, such that certain properties (e.g., the specific volume and cohesive energy density) of the mixed system are simply additive combinations of the pure substances. Therefore, deviations from the Fox equation may reflect non-idealities related to the distribution or interaction of system components.",

  "The presented mechanism is effective in the field range of approximately 1 mT to 10 T. However, photo-CIDNP for this system can also be performed directly at much lower fields down to zero field. Strong hyperpolarization of heteronuclear singlet order was previously observed for C-containing BQ . This order is readily detectable in ZULF NMR, which is nevertheless challenging due to low natural abundance of C and the presence of splitting in the ZULF NMR J-spectrum of 13 C-BQ.",

  "In order to investigate the interaction of the substrate with water molecules, we have performed molecular dynamic simulations for substrates with molecular monolayers that had different packing densities. For the simulations we used the package GROMACS and the generalized Amber force field. Butyl-AAP-C18 phosphonic acids (Figure ) were placed in a rectangular simulation box with dimensions in x-and y-directions that were slightly dependent on the studied system but were not smaller than 16 nm and 5.4 nm, respectively. The restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) charges of the AAP molecules were calculated from the ESP charges using Antechamber. Therefore the geometry of the molecule was optimized with Gaussian16 using a 6-31G(d) basis set. Afterwards the ESP charges were determined with a Hartree Fock calculation. Periodic boundary conditions were present in",
  "The DFT calculations were performed with Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof and generalized gradient approximation under the projector augmented wave method, as implemented in Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP). In electrostatic potential calculations, lattice size perpendicular to the BN interface was set as more than 25 Å to minimize the effect of periodic boundary condition. A plane-wave kinetic energy cut-off of 500 eV was used. 4 × 4 × 2 k-points were used, and the whole system was relaxed until the force on each atom was below 0.01 eV/Å.",
  "Whereas we observe SNR increases of polymers from OCT media in the positive ion mode. These results were not entirely unexpected in the positive ion mode given these washes have been shown to remove alkali adducts and consolidate signal to a singular protonated adduct, boosting sensitivity and the number of lipids detected. One consideration is that increases in ionization of endogenous lipid classes may also be suppressing some polymers. A previous report highlighted that charge discrimination and competition exists between phospholipid classes, where decreased intensity of a static concentration of a phospholipid standard was seen when variable concentrations of another lipid were added. While these results are indeed confirmatory of previous trends, and that polymer signals are reduced, they further serve to highlight the additional areas of concern. Although, when measurement regions exclude tissue borders, regions solely on tissue show intense distributions of broad classes of lipids in both positive and negative ion mode (Figure ), with no observable polymer interferences as can be seen within Figure .",
  "The adsorption constants for different [Mo] aq complexes with the surface of Fh, calculated by SCM, linear free energy relationships (LFER) and the current study are summarized in Table . Although the SCM calculations for adsorbed inner-sphere complexes are performed at pH > 5 and with taking into account the acidity of (HO)MoO 3 -(pK a =4.2), partially or fully protonated Mo species needed to be introduced to improve the model.

  "Firstly, because it is (to our knowledge) the first optics-less biosensor described for detection of V. vulnificus. A purely electrical sensing approach facilitates maintaining a small footprint of the overall setup toward improved portability, allowing as well to introduce in the future multiple sensors in a chip for multiplexed measurements, improving the statistics by detecting the same analyte with various sensors or targeting different pathogens at the time. Secondly, the small size and simplicity of the sensor does not sacrifice the sensitivity. The existing optical (fluorescence) detection approaches result in similar or higher detectable levels, or make use of enrichment or amplification steps with various hours of duration to achieve lower detection limits.",
  "We demonstrate these benefits by training new AEV-PLIG models on PDBbind plus BindingNet data enriched with a small number of complexes sampled for each series in the FEP benchmarks. This approach is inspired by practical insights from early-stage drug discovery projects, which often begin with very little or no prior reference data, but quickly generate new data that can be incorporated directly into a model to improve its accuracy.",

  "Our strategy to achieve ArI(OTf)2 involved a 2-progned approach, in which we attempted to shut down decomposition by EAS (as observed via Zhdankin's pathway) and also achieve an complete conversion of substituents on iodine to triflate (which does not occur for PhI(OAc)2/2 TMS-OTf). For the second goal it was decided to take advantage of the high Si-F bond strength and use Ar-IF2 precursors in conjunction with TMS-OTf. For suppressing EAS we initially attempted blocking the reactive C-H positions with methyl groups. Ar-IF2 precursors were known for the parent phenyl, para-tolyl and 2,4,6-trimethylmesityl derivatives. Several syntheses of these have been reported, we employed Selectfluor in conjunction with corresponding iodoarenes, and also used this method for the unknown pentamethyl substituted derivatives.",

  "Finally, the methods relying on remote directing effect of groups attached to the indole nitrogen, such as the copper catalyzed C6 functionalization of indoles using the phosphinimide directing group,53 were not examined, as 1) the deprotection step involves harsh reduction conditions (e.g. LiAlH4) incompatible with mitragynine's functionalities, or 2) the C6 functionalization is too restrictive in terms of the functionalization chemistry or substrate requirements.54,55",

The Simulation Manager and Segment Runner Cube respectively handle most of the WE logic and the MD propagation, and therefore, are connected to each other in a cyclic fashion to enable bidirectional communication between the WE driver and the MD engine.",
  "Spatial proteomics routinely requires up to several minutes of exposure to various organic solvents and aqueous mixtures for tissue fixation, delipidation, and salt removal as previously demonstrated. These washes represent the true boundaries of sample preparation which preserve the integrity of biomolecular distributions for MSI, and are carefully balanced and optimized depending on tissue adhesion to slides and fat content of the organ. Such protocols have been previously used for spatial proteomics on OCT embedded pancreas, enabling an assessment of endocrine hormones within the organ. When completing a similar protocol optimized for our pancreatic tissues and instrumentation, we do see encouraging results with several dozen proteoform distributions detected despite the use of low mass bias. This low mass bias makes these trials comparable to the spatial lipidomics preparations ensuring that any nondetection of polymers was not an artifact of instrument tuning. However, these remnant distributions of polymers are present and highly abundant with roughly five times the amount of signal as some abundant proteoforms (Figure ). Demonstrating that OCT polymers, which are primarily larger PEG oligomers, will never be extracted within any MSI preparations without also removing all detectable signatures of metabolites, lipids, and proteins from the tissue.",

  "Most failures of tinyIFD in refining the other 30 cases can be attributed to the low concentration or lack of favorable snapshots sampled in MD simulations. 22 cases have no favorable snapshots at all, while five have less than 1.5 %. These reflect the strong upstream dependency on docking quality of the tinyIFD workflow. The remaining failure cases, where MD simulations were able to sample a meaningful portion of favorable poses but the classification failed, illuminate the room for improvement of the tinyIFD, such as taking into account the halogen bonding and effect of metal ions in the ligand design for 3SHY, and accounting for the drastically different ligand designs between template and target receptors. For example, the heat shock protein 90 structures, 1YET and 2BYI, exhibit completely different strategies: the ligand GDM in 1YET is a macrocycle while the design for ligand 2DD in 2BYI specifically exploits the contact surface of Phe137. Similarly, in docking 3CB from 1WSS (factor VIIa) to 2FLB, the target ligand 3CB is much larger than the template ligand 6NH and interacts with a different set of residues.",

  "Relative to the model of core Cd (with four Se coordination), the 113 Cd δiso of thiolate terminated Cdrich facets is downfield shifted. The Cd of nonpolar facets model terminated by amines exhibits nearly the same δiso as core Cd, albeit with larger CSA(Ω). Understandably, compared with core Cd, surface Cd coordinated by three Se atoms and one N atoms (model of nonpolar facets) demonstrate reduced asymmetry and hence pronounced CSA. With increasing N atom coordinated, the δiso of amine terminated Se-rich facets model shifts upfield. Moreover, the 113 Cd chemical shifts of carboxylate terminated Cd-rich facets model manifests even more deshielding. Overall, there is a good agreement between calculation and experimental results, as demonstrated in Figure .",

  "We performed (time-dependent) density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations at the M06-2X/6-31G* level of theory to obtain structures and energies of CDTPA and CDTPA-(MA/MMA) conformers with Q-Chem 5.4 program.

In particular, the minimum energy conical intersection is obtained by the socalled \"direct\" algorithm implemented in Q-Chem 5.4 program. For the computational efficiency, we replaced a long alkyl chain in CDTPA with ethyl group by assuming that local excitations at TCT moiety are dominant in photodissociation reactions. We further calculated excited states of dissociated radicals of TCT moiety at 4SA-CASSCF(3,4)/6-31+G* level of theory using Molpro to check the possibility of photodissociation along the excited state. Natural orbital analysis shows that the excitation energy for the corresponding nπ* transition (D3) is 3.73 eV.",
  "Viologens are a promising anolyte material for AORFBs, the next-generation grid scale long-duration energy storage devices to ensure an economical and secure energy transition. In this work, we introduced a new hydrothermal synthetic method for universal applicability toward water-soluble viologen derivatives, directly producing the preferred chloride salt forms of symmetric and asymmetric structures in one-step reaction. The hydrothermal method is truly a scalable \"green\" synthesis and permitted the systematic screening of nine viologen derivates to glean new structure-property insight for electrolyte optimization. Ultimately, this study resulted in the design of a Dex-DiOH-Vi anolyte with no apparent capacity decay when used in AORFB cycling for 14 days and an anolyte theoretical volumetric capacity of 67 Ah•L -1 . The experimentally unveiled design principles spurred optimization of viologen physiochemical and electrochemical electrolyte properties. With energy dense and stable one-electron viologen performance, pH neutral anolyte is now comparable to alkaline anolyte, 1-8 while permitting pairing with high voltage, waster miscible, and electrochemically stable TEMPO catholytes (Figure -S57). This highlights the importance of developing high-throughput synthetic methods to empirically screen complex structure-property relationships of organic redox molecules. Such insights will permit molecular engineering of ideal AORFB electrolyte",

The protein environment favors charge separation along the active L branch. With only electrostatic embedding, the CT states are found >0.5 eV above the exciton states, and asymmetry between the branches is diminished. The polarization in the protein is largely dictated by the secondary structure, with induced dipoles pointing along the axes of α-helices.",

  "Good thermal stability of any resist being a desirable property, we evaluated the thermal stability of gets cleaved upon exposure. This loss of alkyl chain in organotin species has been widely studied and reported in the literature. As a result, the exposure of pristine BTA film with suitable light source results in outgassing and cause substantial vertical shrinkage of the film after exposure. Following in-depth examination of each individual component, we focused on the XPS analysis of the CMeBTA (Figure , refer to the Materials and Method section for DUV exposure details). As expected, C 1s peaks suffered loss of peak intensity while O 1s and Sn 3d (Figure ) showed increase in their corresponding intensities after the DUV exposure.",

Crystal structures were identified via ICSD 08 4611 (MnxFe3-xO4) and 68174 (Mn3O4). Crystal sizes were obtained via the Scherrer equation. Dynamic light scattering was conducted using a Zetasizer (Nano ZS90, Malvern Instruments).

  "As discussed above, two structure types have been proposed for LaSe 2 , so we initially investigate both (P2 1 /c 15 and P4/nmm ) phases using both hybrid and standard DFT. The crystal structures are depicted in Figure : both demonstrate similar 9-coordinate environments for all La ions, as well as the tetrahedrally coordinated Se 2 -in the La-Se layer; the structures only differ in the arrangement of the plane of Se -, forming a square lattice in the tetragonal structure, or pairwise distorted to form individual Se-Se covalent bonds in the monoclinic structure. After geometry optimization, the lattice parameters with each different functional, with comparisons to the original experimental data, are given in Table 1. Across both structures, while PBEsol underestimates all lattice lengths, both hybrid functionals give lattice parameters highly consistent with the room temperature structures and the PBE functional that both hybrid functionals derive from performs similarly. As such, the structures as relaxed with the corresponding hybrid functional were used for all future calculations, with the exception of the phonon properties below, due to the high cost associated with performing hybrid DFT simulations on supercells.",

  "Here n A 0 is the confined spherical atom density of atom A. Both schemes differ slightly due to the non-linear nature of the exchange-correlation potential. In practice, potential superposition has been reported to yield better band structures, while most SCC-DFTB models aimed at predicting energies and forces use density superposition. Here, it is common practice to use two different confinement radii, one for the basis functions (r 0 w ) and one for the atomic densities (r 0 d ). This affords the parameterization of the Hamiltonian matrix elements some additional flexibility.

  "These analyses were complicated by the fact that the calix [4]arene crown was found to take on an asymmetrical oval shape, a consequence of the effect of the bridge on the symmetry structure of the molecule. This resulted in otherwise-equivalent NMR protons appearing at several different distances in our calculated structures. While NOESY provided only tentative hints toward the cone geometry through apparent proximity of protons on the relevant phenol groups, the ROESY spectrum was conclusive in identifying a CH 2 to the Ph bridge distance of 2.42 ± 0.14 that was consistent only with the cone conformer. The methods we have demonstrated may find wider use in the analysis of complex calix [4]arene molecules and their 3D geometry and conformational structure and can be especially helpful during exploratory synthetic campaigns involving the complex synthesis of new calixarenes.",

  "The level of theory employed in this work, DFT B3LYP/6-311+(2p,2d) with GD3BJ empirical dispersion , follows from the important experimental validation of the method conducted by Schilberg and coworkers . They identified stable structural conformers of PFOA by comparing Bentel and coworkers employed the same model chemistry for their extensive study of bond dissociation energies of per-and polyfluorinated carboxylates and sulfonates at varying chain lengths . That study, unlike this one, employed the SMD model to provide implicit simulation of solvation in water. We tested the model but ultimately chose not to include it in this work. Critically, the dielectric cavity generated by the implicit model stabilizes a local metastable conformational minimum preceding a critical transition state, clouding the reaction mechanism revealed by the simulation method. In fact, the developers of SMD have shown that it is not well suited for ion dissociation calculations without including a shell of explicit water molecules, an issue observed across ionic solutes expected to have a strong hydrogen bonding interaction with water . The PFAS species under investigation here are compact and electron rich, indicating that the intramolecular forces, rather than solvent interactions, are decisive. For these reasons, the high computational expense of computationally-sound explicit aqueous solvation is neither justified nor required for the simulation sets that follow.",

  "Next, a novel \"donor-acceptor\" Pt-catalyst, which was developed by Grubbs et al., has shown remarkable efficiency (0.1 mol%) that facilely hydrated the nitrile motif in compound 6 into the corresponding primary amide motif. The following aza-Michael addition was triggered by adding DBU into aforementioned reaction mixture to give lactam 5 (90% from 6). Subsequently, a Hutchins-Kabalka reductive rearrangement furnished alkene 10 from compound 5. to the ,-unsaturated enone motif in compound 13 followed by sequential oxidations furnished the 1,3-diketone functionality in compound 3 (64%, 2 steps). Other attempts at this transformation, such as hydroboration/oxidation or epoxidation/epoxide opening/oxidation process, either suffered low yields or decomposition of starting materials. In turn, a palladium-catalyzed Tsuji-Trost allylation reaction introduced the allyl group, yielding the O-alkylated product 14 instead of the C-alkylated product 15. Hence, a Claisen rearrangement was employed to convert enol ether 14 into compound 15, which bears the pivotal C-8 quaternary center that is vicinal to the C-5 quaternary center. This critical Claisen rearrangement occurred on the convex face and, the stereochemistry of substrate 15 was later assigned by the single-crystal X-ray diffraction of its descendant, compound 9. We next required an efficient tactic to fabricate the cyclopentane motif. While routine hydroboration conditions (BH3 or 9-BBN) failed to convert the terminal alkene motif in compound 15 into the corresponding primary alcohol, other conditions such as anti-Markovnikov Wacker oxidation or olefin cross-metathesis were also fruitless.",
  "where E alloy slab denotes the total energy of the slab, A is the surface area, E host S represents the surface energy of the unrelaxed bottom side.

We limited the sums in Eq. 2 to nearest-neighbor pairs because only these pairs entered the encoding of the diffusion barrier heights. Thus the input for the kMC simulations and the lattice gas Hamiltonian are consistent. Note that the pair energies Pt-Pt and Ag-Ag are evaluated from a full monolayer of Pt and Ag on the host substrates, respectively.",

  "While other test cases show that anharmonic treatment typically exhibits the weakest cluster stability at high SVpp -declustering at lower bath temperatures and SVpp compared to harmonic treatmentsthe contrary is true in the case of 3-bromoquinoline with 1.50 mol% MeOH (Figure ). Here, harmonic treatments (with and void of corrections) show Type B behaviour at 373 K, indicating complete declustering around 3000 SVpp (Figure ). Anharmonic and experimental data both exhibit Type A curves, indicating stronger clustering, and have somewhat similar curve shapes. At higher temperatures the anharmonic data exhibits Type B behaviour, but also indicates that ion-solvent cluster stability is much closer to experimental values than those calculated under each harmonic treatment given the smaller CV and SVpp shift observed (Figure ). The above trends hold true for data obtained at 2.25 mol% and 3.00 mol% MeOH concentrations (Figure ).",

Since the experimental mixing enthalpy of -2.24 kJ mol -1 for the equimolar mixture is only about half the value of what was observed from MD simulation, this smaller mixing enthalpy is apparently solely attributed to a less pronounced shift of the equilibrium of K = y OMs /y OTf towards [OMs] anions.",

High-throughput experimentation (HTE), which can conduct reactions at the micro-to nanomolar scale, also shares the advantages of microfluidics in avoiding handling bulk chemicals and having compact reactor dimensions. In addition, the highly standardized nature of HTE wellplates enables safety practices developed by one group to be quickly adopted by other practitioners running a similar workflow.",

  "We tracked the deflections for a set of eight bulges from the total 59 that were inflated with 150-kPa N2 for 110 d (Fig. ). No statistically significant deflation occurred over that time that would indicate gas escaped the microwell at rates above our measurement detection limit. We confirmed the successful trapping of N2 over that duration by gently puncturing a bulge with an AFM tip, observing it collapse immediately after the pressure was released (fig. ). The inability of both pressurized N2 to escape bulges and atmospheric N2 to equilibrate negatively pressured dimples, where Δ𝑝 !\"# < Δ𝑝 $#% , points to a film that is N2-impermeable. This finding corroborates the lack of accessible pore surface area measured for 2DPA-1 platelets via Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), where N2 was used as the probe gas .",

Regarding the emission, the Stoke shift, computed at TDDFT level, of the L a state with respect to the absorption is about 45 nm, which is underestimated of 30 nm from the experimental counterpart. This aspect was also previously reported, and it can be again ascribed to the single-reference nature of TDDFT. To this end, for instance, Dreuwet al. employed the algebraic diagrammatic construction (ADC) scheme of the polarization propagator at the second and third orders, while DFT-based multi-reference configuration interaction DFT/MRCI method was used by Russo et al. to obtain good Stoke shifts. In the present context, since the polar nature of La state, we mainly focus on the underlying mechanism of the stabilization of this state in solution.",
  "The quasi-static mechanism of dynamic catalysis is defined by rate enhancement at the high frequency limit, where forced kinetic oscillations occur much more rapidly than elementary step interconversion of surface species. Consequently, surface coverages are effectively time-invariant, or quasistatic.

Similarly, the significantly lower capacity of VRnzZ-50-630 can be attributed to a much lower pore volume, only becoming competitive with the PO-activated samples at very low pressures. Unlike for CO2 capture, the composition of the samples plays little role in improving CH4 uptake thus the relatively high low-pressure must be solely attributed to porosity. In a similar manner to CO2 uptake, the PO-activated samples achieve similar high and low pressure CH4 uptakes to those reported by Attia and co-workers, despite our much simpler synthetic methods. Indeed, stabilisation of VR can be completely foregone to achieve greater total capacity than found previously, at 20 bar.",
  "The Dogleg incorporated two pairs of deflector electrodes, utilizing high potentials over 3 kV of opposite polarities. The final quadrupolar lens was built from four PCB printed rectangular electrodes, each independently controllable so that a quadrupolar focusing field could be applied in addition to a superimposed radial deflection. Also shown in Figure is a simulated m/z 195 ion arrival time spread at a virtual focus located after the point of injection. At 10.4 ns full-width halfmaximum (FWHM), this appears to be very broad for an ion injection device, certainly much defocused compared to the time-focus immediately after the R-Trap of 3.3 ns. It transpired that the dual deflector concept of the Dogleg added substantial aberrations with respect to initial ion energy, which ultimately constrained performance of the physical analyzer. Simulation of the OrbiTOF analyzer itself is shown in Figure , including the injection portion. As MASIM3D calculates aberrational expansion, the long and otherwise timeconsuming multiple reflection path could be split up into a small number of discrete trajectory simulations, that were then assembled. Aside from injection and extraction, one figure eight oscillation is very much like the next, with only buildup of errors and a shift in circumferential position. Therefore 26 of the 30 oscillations were assembled from duplicates of a single trajectory, whilst those in the vicinity of the Trapezoid had their own. This unified trajectory is shown as a function of one radial axis, Y and the mirror axis Z, as well as radial position vs Z. The precession of each oscillation relative to the previous one is visible, and a small portion of the button belt is drawn to show the how each pass accesses a different button lens. The principal trajectory is observed to maintain a 100mm radius with only a small radial oscillation, though there was only a few mm leeway in either direction. The axial oscillation amplitude was ±130 mm.",

  "Replica exchange was applied during both the string optimization and the umbrella sampling stages with exchange attempts performed every 100 fs. To monitor the dehalogenation and the hydrolysis steps of the overall reaction catalyzed by LinB four collective variables (CVs) were defined, namely the cleavage of the carbon-bromine bond, attacked carbon atom of a ligandnucleophile oxygen atom, Od1, water oxygen -CG atom of nucleophile, and CG -Od1 interatomic distances. One of the two final productsa brominated corresponding alcohol was assumed to possess the H1 proton of the water molecule. In the case of dbe it was bromoethanol, for 1br2cle -2-chloroethanol, whereas in the case of 1,2-dbp it was 1-bromo-2-propanol. Fifty string nodes were used to follow the reaction progress to the products. These nodes were propagated according to the mean force and kept equidistant, converging to the MFEP. Then a path CV, denoted as s, was defined to measure the advance of the system along the MFEP from reactants to products and used as the reaction coordinate to trace the potential of mean force (PMF) associated with the reaction under analysis. At this stage simulations were performed until the statistical error of the free energy barriers drops below 1 kcal•mol -1 . To ensure that the simulated system is close to the position of the node in the CV space, a biasing potential perpendicular to the minimum free energy path Vb(z) was applied.",

  "The metal-doped NC synthesis route described here can also be extended to other dopants beyond manganese, as we show in the following. For both exemplary NC sizes shown in each case, the metal-doped NCs feature a distinct optical blue shift upon metal doping. Similarly to the Mn-doped case, this is not a size or halide composition effect, as the mean sizes of undoped and doped NCs are similar, as determined by TEM (Fig. ), and an excess of Cl - is added in all cases to fully shift to a pure-chloride composition. This optical blue-shift instead arises from the bandgap opening due to the same, element-unspecific lattice-periodicity breaking effect described before. Such alternative dopants are particularly exciting for light-emitting applications, as Ni and Zn can increase the radiative rate of these NCs and push their emission wavelength to the near-UV, especially when now combinable with the access to the strong confinement regime, but without featuring an additional decay channel towards the broad, slow orange additional emission as Mn does.",
  "The effect of introducing defects into orthorhombic Sb2Se3 on the intercalation of monovalent foreign ions was first probed using density functional theory (DFT). Our reference reactions confirmed that stoichiometric and highly crystalline Sb2X3 (X=S, Se) TFs require external driving forces to initiate any adequate cation replacement. We have previously demonstrated that monovalent activations by H, Cl, and OH of sulfide (selenide) matrices introduce numerous charge-compensating metal site vacancies, facilitating intercalation/de-intercalation of foreign ions such as polyvalent Sn or trivalent Sb .",

Wastewater influent concentrations were processed via the equations outlined in section 2.5.2., using: daily WWTP influent flow; population estimates (Table ); and CFs calculated from the median analyte excretion (Table ). The resultant DI, per metabolite, were subsequently checked for concordance with prescription records associated with the catchment. The results of which are described in figures Figure 8. The interpretation of these results was achieved by considering each aspect of the process: Drug prescribed (PNDP); drug ingested, and metabolites excreted (CF); analyte stability in sewer system and composite sampler; analyte recovery from SPE-UPLC-MS/MS method; and data processed for the calculation of daily mass loads (DL), population-normalised loads and intake (DI).",
  "CW EPR results have shown that a strong decrease in binding affinity towards 16-DSA takes place at temperatures above 53 °C, which indicates the release and redistribution process of bound ligands during HSA denaturation but does not allow one to locate the remaining binding sites. In Figures S4 it is furthermore shown that binding site cooperativity changes with temperature and we have tested whether 4pulse DEER can provide further insights into the redistribution, or interconversion process.",

For all systems, a kinetic energy cutoff of 500 eV was used for plane wave expansions, along with the default pseudopotentials for all elements. Dispersion corrections were omitted at this stage to avoid complications with machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), which often struggle with fitting long-range interactions. Dispersion corrections can be introduced during subsequent fine-tuning if necessary.",
  "to reduce the number of cases exhibiting artificial spin symmetry breaking by approximating Brueckner orbitals. In systems with large t amplitudes due to already small orbital energy denominators, the use of OOMP2 can push the system toward a zero orbital energy gap in order to decrease the total energy, leading to divergence of the energy as well as the erroneous removal of Coulson-Fischer points. This effect is well visualized in a plot of the largest t amplitudes for several hundred main group molecules as seen in figure ;",
  "and negative (q -= -q) point charges with the same magnitude placed exactly on top of each other (r + = r -= r). Since each test charge dimer is overall neutral, the energies of the test charges in the electrostatic potential V cancel exactly, and the Hamiltonian of the system is left unchanged. A bond with zero force constant is added between the test charges in the topology file so that their mutual Coulomb attraction is turned off, following a 1-3 exclusion rule.",
  "Based on this proof of concept, we develop a new type of electron-deficient helicenes from the main-group phosphine substrates by virtue of optimized Mn(III)-mediated C-P bond cyclization, where the substrates carry electron-rich carbazole or triphenylamine groups. Although competitive single-electron oxidation might exist between N and P atoms, the first single-electron oxidation (SET) event proceeds on the P(III)-atom via the coordination assistance, generating a helical phosphonium core with extreme electron deficiency. Thus, the helical D-A phosphoniums with diverse HLCT and fluorescence switches are built (Δλem up to 0.78 eV). The further SET oxidation of phosphonium by AgSbF6 affords ammonium trications with high diradical character (y0 = 0.989) and unusual stability. Variabletemperature electron spin resonance (VT-ESR) suggests a singlet ground state and a small single-triplet gap of -0.24 kcal mol -1 . Density functional theory (DFT) calculations unveil that the electron-deficient phospha [5]helication has no obvious contribution to the spin delocalization via TBC, but the folded helical overlay points out a perfect overlay of two radical spots, which is quite different from the other reported carbon[n]helicene diradicals. In contrast, the Cu(II)-mediated C-H bond cleavage and C-P bond cyclization produce complex multiple diradicals on the P and N atoms without priority.",

Fortunately, we could study all compounds generated in this iterative step through co-crystal structures (Figure ) in complex with the hTBD homolog MsCI4. These data confirmed that the preferred orientation of the ortho substituent towards the amide NH was preserved in the bound state of all ligands except for 11b. However, the intrinsic preference of these atoms for the formation of H-bonds through van der Waals forces may facilitate mimicking the bonded pose as in isoindoles of types 2 and 3.",

  "We thus turned to use, instead of dipolar couplings, J-couplings by implementing INEPT, which we optimized for the short proton 𝑇 # -relaxation times (average 1.8 ms) using numerical simulations (Figure ) . While solid-state NMR usually employs refocused INEPT (rINEPT), we turned, in order to minimize relaxation losses, to the shorter non-refocused INEPT (referred simply to as INEPT in the following). Delay times of around 1.2 ms should be optimal to observe the CTD residues. To avoid problems with water suppression, we used samples in D2O. in Figure ). New resonances, not present in the NTD spectrum (orange) appear in both fulllength capsid spectra around random-coil positions (red circles in Figure and Figure ) which we assign to the CTD, since their proton chemical shifts coincide with the ones in the EXSY (see Figure for 1D overlay).

  "We have introduced a microscopic model of SCO materials based on crystal-field theory including intra-and inter-molecular vibrations. We explicitly include the spin-orbit interaction that induces zero-field splittings within the HS manifold and the coupling between the HS and LS states (via the IS state). This model provides a unified picture of thermal and lightinduced spin-crossover. The calculated magnetic susceptibility is in striking agreement with experiments on SCO materials. Our theory reproduces and explains the inverse correlation between T 1/2 and T LIESST , in excellent agreement with experimental data. It explains that the different T 0 values found in SCO materials with ligands with different denticities results from the increase in inner coordination sphere stiffness with denticity.",

  "Results also showed that for the range of survey times per equipment unit obtained in this study, the TPFs evaluated per experiment did not statistically significantly correlate (SI section S-7.4) with the associated survey times per equipment unit (except for solution I). This indicates that high TP detection performance is possible at relatively shorter survey times if solutions' survey methodologies are optimized, weather and environmental conditions are favorable (i.e., wind, road accessibility, etc.), and solutions are at high readiness level for field deployment. In general, this study's detection, localization, and survey times data indicate that tested mobile and handheld solutions likely should have different value propositions: perform quicker surveys and narrow down emission sources with mobile solutions to facilitate closer inspections and measurement with handheld solutions -which showed better detection and localization performance.",

  "Our calculations were performed within the framework of pseudopotential plane-wave DFT as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) code.

Explicit convergence testing with criteria of 5 meV atom -1 for the plane-wave kinetic-energy cutoff and 1 meV atom -1 for the k-point sampling mesh suggested a 400 eV cutoff for both structures and Γ-centred k-point meshes with 5×5×7 and 5×5×6 subdivisions for Ca 4 Sb 2 O and Ca 4 Bi 2 O respectively (Figure ). During the geometry optimisations the cutoff was increased to 520 eV to avoid Pulay stress.

When TPPO (29) or electron-rich phosphines 30-32 were used, inseparable mixtures of product 28a (43 -66%) and starting material 27a (traces -7%) were obtained. Addition of phenanthrene ( ) led to the clean formation of the desired product 28a in 76% yield. These results indicate that our developed protocol works better for direct electrochemical reduction of styrenes. However, it remains unclear if the reduction of 27a was achieved in direct or mediated fashion when mediator-containing conditions were used.",
  "QM cluster calculations of the HAT reactions for each enzyme-substrate system were performed with developer version 1.9 of the GPU-accelerated quantum chemistry package TeraChem. To account for the iron center, all potential energy surface scans were carried out using the spin-unrestricted hybrid functional UB3LYP with the composite basis set LACVP*, where the LANL2DZ effective core potential was applied to iron and 6-31G* was applied to the other atoms. We chose this modest basis set to better accommodate larger cluster models since many residues contribute to the positioning of the substrate. The zero-point vibrational corrections were not calculated to reduce computational overhead for the larger clusters, and only electronic energies were compared. Long range interactions were accounted for by incorporating semiempirical DFT-D3 with default Becke-Johnson damping. To approximate the impact of the greater protein environment on the electrostatic potential of the cluster models, the calculations were carried out with implicit conductor-like polarizable continuum model (C-PCM) with epsilon set to 10. During all QM calculations, the backbone atoms were frozen to maintain the overall structure observed in the selected centroids. Potential energy surface scans were then performed using the TeraChem implementation where a given reaction coordinate was incrementally changed and fixed while geometry optimizing all other degrees of freedom. For each subsequent step, the wave function of the previous step was used as an initial guess to improve continuity of the scan. New minima were used as a restart point if identified during the scan. Succinate was modelled as acetate for the potential energy surface scans to avoid unphysical interactions between the second coordination sphere and non-coordinating terminus of succinate, as motivated by previous work. All other calculations and simulations used the full structure of succinate.",

  "As an example, refinement of cross-docked pose of ligand V1B from 7QBB to 5R84 is shown in Figure . AutoDock Vina did not produce a favorable pose for this case (best pose is 3.08 Å), but the tinyIFD workflow was able to rescue the docking failure and suggest a pose that is 0.57 Å RMSD to the crystal pose with the inclusion of three 5R84-based models. Because of the (identical) protein sequence that gave a Levenshtein distance of 0, these models from the same protein are heavily weighted during the pose quality prediction stage. This demonstrates the use of active learning; when more data is available for a specific protein, the workflow naturally utilizes these more local data to predict the pose quality, and the performance increases. Note the reason that the performance seemed to be capped at 70% success rate is due to that, only 80% of the cases have MD snapshots of ligands in a favorable pose.",

A plane-wave cutoff of 400 Ry has been imposed. Exchange and correlation (XC) effects were treated with the gradient-corrected Becke-Lee-Yang-Parr (BLYP) density functional. Moreover, in order to take into account dispersion interactions, we employed the dispersion-corrected version of BLYP (i.e., BLYP+D3(BJ)) . A nominal temperature slightly higher than the standard one has been simulated in order to better reproduce the water structure (i.e., T =350 K). The dynamics of ions was simulated classically within a constant number, volume, and temperature (NVT) ensemble, using the Verlet algorithm whereas the canonical sampling has been executed by employing a canonical-sampling-through-velocity-rescaling thermostat (CSVR) set with a time constant equal to 50 fs.",
  "If there are important reaction steps or interactions missing in the MKM or the wrong catalytic surface is assumed in the MKM, the GA will still attempt to fit the target, but now by changing the DFT computed parameters beyond expectation. When this happens, it is an indication to reevaluate the assumptions behind the constructed MKM after ensuring that the errant values have been computed correctly.",
  "We have previously reported the development of a high-throughput setup for the cycling of redox flow batteries, which allows for the benchmarking of capacity fade rates and variations in cycling behaviour of nominally identical flow cells. As shown herein, augmentation of this system with elevated temperature cell cycling capabilities allows for increased testing throughput of AORFBs. We demonstrate accelerated lifetime testing of multiple previously published aqueous RAOMs via elevated temperature cycling of nominally identical volumetrically unbalanced compositionally symmetric cells. Results from over 30 elevated temperature symmetric cells are reported.",
  "(2) The absolute value of this potential difference is proportional to 1/y. Thus, the lower the metal-to-fluoride ratio in the MFy compound, the higher will be │ΔU│. If one considers a pair of metal fluorides MFm and MFn of the same metal m with m < n, this implies that the fluoride-poor metal fluorides can strongly favor metal carbide formation if ΔHcarb.form.",
  "The application of ML approaches to transition metal complexes has been even slower as the number of curated datasets is hitherto very limited. The Kulik group has made notable developments towards the application of ML towards the efficient search of vast chemical spaces for optimised transition metal complexes. Balcells et al. recently described a new representation for deep graph learning on transition metal complexes. In the field of homogeneous catalyst development, the group of Corminboeuf reported the application of genetic optimisation as a tool to accelerate catalyst discovery. An additional difficulty when dealing with metal complexes is that standard string representations such as SMILES tend to not be generally applicable. However, many cheminformatics tools rely on these representations to translate molecules into a computer-readable format that can be utilised for training of ML models.",
  "In a recent work, we described an extremely inert indium complex formed with a reinforced \"cross-bridged\" dipicolinate cyclam [In(cb-te2pa)] + (Figure ). This previous study led to a first proof of concept on Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC TM ) with the use of polyamino polystyrene beads grafted with the bifunctional isothiocyanate analogue of [In(cb-te2pa)] + . IMC images of good quality of the resulting beads were obtained due to the efficient detection of",
  "For LaMnO 3 (orange), only the PW86PBE DFA shows an improvement over mash -it is also the bestperforming DFA for the whole set. On the other hand, when we use the RDF method in critic2 (see Fig. ), the DFAs are grouped much closer together with no clear best performer. With the exception of BLYP, all other DFAs significantly improve over the starting structures generated with mash, approximately halving the dissimilarity score. This qualitative disagreement between the two methods for comparison of crystal structures in critic2 is puzzling, as both metrics should include the effects of lattice constants as well as the atomic positions within the lattice.",
  "First attempts to perform constrained molecular dynamics simulations with thermodynamic integration in estimating activation and reaction (free) energies have indeed already be performed , and substantial changes in reaction energies has been found upon the consideration of solvent dynamics. Unfortunately, such calculations are not routinely feasible at the moment. The modelling of electrocatalytic processes by first-principles electronic structure calculations is very popular at the moment due to the importance of electrochemically energy conversion and storage for our future sustainable energy supply .",
  "To quantify the agreement between the rank ordering of chemical series between two different assays, we calculated the coefficient of determination (R 2 ) and the Kendall rank correlation coefficient (Kendall's τ ) of absolute binding free energies ∆G a = kT ln(X a ). When X is an IC 50 , these absolute binding free energies include an unknown additive constant that has no effect on rank and correlation measures.",
  "To address these challenges, we have developed a CuO/Co3O4 based reagent-free, easy -use, cost-effective, accurate electrochemical sensor to allow real-time in-field monitoring . Fig. shows the graphical abstract of phosphate sensor and electrochemistry setup using Autolab instrument. The application of silicon chip digital technologies has tremendous potential on agriculture applications by enabling rapid analysis to provide high-end analytical data on different analytes. CuO/Co3O4 multi oxide structure provides good electrochemical behavior in terms of limit of detection (LOD), sensitivity and lifetime. The sensor has been optimized and challenged under lab conditions in buffer solutions to achieve the analytical specifications required (<2 ppm).",
  "However, the forcefield used in that study did not allow for charge redistribution-important given the partially covalent character of the Al-O bond-or proton transfer, which could be part of the dissociation mechanism itself (as shown in this work, vide infra). Therefore, a hamiltonian able to handle these aspects is needed, as pointed out in their work.",
  "The 2-particle reduced density matrix (2RDM) approaches have gained interest in electronic structure literature due to their ability to describe the electronic wavefunction without the exponential increase in complexity . An interesting exploitation of ML was done by Sager-Smith and Mazziotti, where the orbital energies and their Boltzmann-like distribution at various temperatures are fed into an NN to produce the effective correlation temperature. Their model performs very well for the hydrocarbons to reproduce results from more expensive quantum mechanical calculations, although its transferability to other systems is yet to be investigated. Another approach uses variational 2RDM to extract particle entropy among other features to reproduce higher accuracy energies .",
  "The initial structural model of the Agp2 phytochrome in the resting (Pfr) state was generated starting from the 6G1Y entry of the Protein Data Bank. H++ web server was used to determine the protonation at pH 7. In particular, His248 and His278 were protonated on the Nϵ site. We modeled the biliverdin chromophore (BV) with all pyrrole rings and the ring C propionic side chain protonated. Partial charges of the BV were computed using the RESP protocol on top of a B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) electrostatic potential calculation. The chromophore and its bonding interactions with the covalently bonded cysteine residue (Cys13), were described with the GAFF force-field . The protein was described with the AMBER ff14SB forcefield, while water molecules were with the TIP3P model 53 . The dimeric system was soaked in a truncated octahedron water box and electrically neutralized with 0.15M NaCl. The production run was carried out without any restraint for 2 µs in the NPT ensemble, of which we discarded the first 500 ns. Average-quantity analyses were made on the remaining 1.5 µs (15000 frames per trajectory). More details are reported in the supplementary information. All molecular dynamics simulations were run with AMBER18.",
  "Importantly, this consistency check can be added to any WHAM code, and can be calculated even when the WHAM equations did not converge to facilitate error correction.

  "Catalase or MnO2 takes role in this . Nanoparticles loaded with these oxygen-producing moiety and anticancer drugs are already studied. For example, Chen et al. co-assembled catalase and human serum albumin (HSA) which is formerly attached with PS Ce6 and then conjugated with anticancer drug paclitaxel (PTX) to generate HSA-Ce6-Cat-PTX for PTX induced intratumoral perfusion, hypoxia relieving combinational therapy . reported hypoxia relaxing UCNPs based system, UCNPs@ mSiO2@Ce6&α-ketoglutarate&GOx@mMnO2@HA for multimodal imaging guided cancer therapy where MnO2 produces O2 and acted as MRI contrast agent and also promoted Fenton-like agent. Here, authors claimed that the generated O2 enhanced PDT by relieving hypoxia. Glucose oxidase (GOx) oxidized intratumoral glucose (Glu) thus induced starvation therapy (ST) and the generated H2O2 and glucuronic acid further amplified the chemodynamic therapy (CDT).",

These include improvements to the Hamiltonian facilitated by ∆-ML, exemplified by the Artificial Intelligence-Quantum Mechanical Method 1 (AIQM1) , backpropagation through Hamiltonian parameters, as seen in the ML-enhanced extended Hückel model (ML-EHM) , fitting of repulsive contributions and electronic integrals in density functional tight-binding (DFTB) , predicting the energy from DFTB solution as in OrbNet , and full analytical mapping of the electronic Hamiltonian, as enabled by the ML-augmented atomic cluster expansion (ML-ACE) .",

  "We visually analyzed the poorly predicted structures (detailed in Appendix D), which revealed that seven out of the ten exhibited twisted or misaligned interfaces that could probably be refined through energy minimization or MD simulations. The remaining three poorly-predicted cases (PDB IDs: 8QVU, 8QW6, and 8QW7) showed other types of prediction errors, particularly in POI alignment, while E3 ligase predictions remained relatively accurate.",
  "All the 3D model structures were designed similarly, as reported earlier by our group . Fusion 360 (Autodesk) software was used to create different model structures with varying topographies and infill patterns, and these designed models were exported in the STEP (Standard for the Exchange of Product Data) format for FEA simulations. All the simulations were carried out by using the thermal expansion model in commercial software Abaqus/CAE 2017 (Simulia 2017) to predict the deformation of the designed hydrogel structures computationally.",
  "We also did simulations for a CH2h and a CH3h spin system, with JCh = 0, JCH, JHh ≠ 0. For the CH2h system, surprisingly even with ideally set 123 = 1/(2*JCH), a signal results. Therefore, it is expected that homonuclear JHH' coupling always produce artifacts for CH2 groups in Cq-only spectra (Figure ). However, the artifact's intensity is still extremely low and will not be visible in experimental data containing noise (Figure ).",
  "Conventional UQ approaches for GNNs include ensemble methods, Monte Carlo dropout, evidential methods, and mean-variance estimation techniques . Ensemble models leverage the consensus among multiple models trained on different data subsets or with varying architectures. As test data diverges from the training distribution, independently initialized and trained models with different architectures or data should yield increasingly divergent predictions. Similarly, Monte Carlo dropout exploits architectural sampling by stochastically deactivating network weights during training. Evidential methods, inspired by subjective logic and Dempster-Shafer theory , learn to predict the parameters of probability distributions directly, allowing for second-order uncertainty estimation that distinguishes between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty without requiring multiple forward passes.",
  "It is found that total polar surface area for selected 16 drugs lies between 43.7 and 202.26 which is within the optimal range. H bond donors and acceptors are in the optimal range for all drugs excluding Azithromysin. Methylprednisolone, Colchicine, Ifenprodil, Dexamethasone, Baricitinib and Umifenovir portray satisfactory ADME-TOX properties but fall short on the aspect of docking score. Ritonovir and TMC-310911 lack drug-likeliness properties with violation of all 5 rules though the docking value holds good. Bioavailability (0.17) of both the drugs is very less due to high polarity, high molecular weight and several rotatable bonds. Brain and intestinal permeation are two crucial factors in order to evaluate the pharmacokinetics properties. Low lipophilicity and high polarity primarily fostered a small gastrointestinal absorption for both the drugs as per BOILED-Egg method secondly non permeability to blood brain barrier. In addition to this, both are Cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitor. Many drugs are biotransformed by Cytochrome P450 isozymes, this leads to decreased efficacy and increased toxicity. Besides Abivertinib is the most potent drug with appropriate lipophilicity, pharmacokinetic and drug-likeness properties (98 A2 TPSA, 3.57 Log P, -5.41 Log S and 0.55 bioavailability). This drug is only violating the Ghose rule.",
  "All SIMS measurements were conducted using the CAMECA IMS SC Ultra instrument with a cesium ion source. To achieve atomic depth resolution, several procedural modifications were implemented as outlined previously 69 : high-angle incidence bombardment (75°), ultra-low impact energy (100 eV), in-situ ion polishing, optimization of extraction settings, the use of a super cycle, and precise beam positioning. Furthermore, a deconvolution and calibration protocol was employed to quantify the data and accurately determine the composition of each atomic layer.",
  "Neglecting this complication in the present calculations, deuteration makes the forward rate nearly 25 times slower when quantified by the overall rate constant k ET (Table ). This change comes from the alteration of the dynamical crossover parameter g in eq 4. The main effect of deuteration on the reaction dynamics is through the reaction pre-exponential factor (eq 1).",
  "A second mutation is also relevant, in which the putative, standard model, gating charges, R297, R300, and R303, are replaced by isosteric, but uncharged, citrulline. Fig. shows the result of a calculation of R303cit, which helps to understand the experimental left shift in the Q -V curve found for this mutation. These shifts make several interatomic distances differ from WT by about 1 Å, in addition to the F266 ring rotation, with its effect on H + -π interaction; these are shown in Fig. . None of the side chain changes is individually large, but collectively they can easily account for a difference of several kBT in energy. One expects that a loss of gating charge would accompany disruption of this system, although this calculation cannot directly show that. Standard models would make an opposite prediction; the removal of the -OH should make sliding S4 easier, producing a left shift. Y266 ionization in WT is the only apparent explanation for the effect of the Y266F mutation.",
  "However, what about a comprehensive characterization and deep insight into the mechanisms responsible for the arising spin splitting? Even if it occurs in new materials, without a welldescribed mechanism behind the splitting, the potential for developing more robust strategies for enhancing spin splitting will be limited despite the clear need for guiding principles in GSS engineering. Unfortunately, this is the aspect where many chemicallyoriented investigations fall short.",
  "The optimality of equal activation energies is highly reminiscent of the Sabatier principle that has been successfully invoked previously to explain volcano plots as a function of an intermediate energy for a variety of heterogeneous catalytic systems. This principle states that the best catalyst is obtained when an intermediate is bound at the best compromise value between the attachment step and the release step of the cycle. It has been shown that using an intermediate binding energy as an independent variable, one finds approximate Brønsted type linear scaling relations for transition states for diverse systems such as ammonia synthesis, ethanol conversion, and electrochemical reduction. Does disorder fit into this pattern? As a test, we computed the energies of all the wells and barriers versus a key intermediate energy, viz. that for structure 24",
  "To establish a representative benchmark for the discussed statistical models, we conducted a detailed exploration of the classical phase space for each studied system through Metropolis Monte Carlo (MC) sampling. Specifically, we employed a semi-grand canonical simulation scheme developed by Vehkamäki and collaborators. In these simulations, canonical ensemble averages of the grand canonical growth and decay probabilities, G N and D N for each cluster size, were calculated at some reference vapor monomer density N ′ 1 . Based on these probabilities, the formation cluster free energy can be determined recursively and scaled to any desired N 1 according to the formula 53",

  "In order to compare reaction representations built from either reaction SMILES or three-dimensional structure, we include two recently published datasets of activation barriers that provide both input formats: the GDB7-22-TS 117 and Cyclo-23-TS. The CGR and QM-GNN have been tested for each set respectively, which allows for an interesting broader comparison across different reaction fingerprints. As a nod to our original benchmarking work, we also include the Proparg-21-TS set of reaction barriers, which provides only three-dimensional structure as the input format. In order to allow comparison to other methods we also convert these to reaction SMILES (vide supra).",
  "In this work, on-the-fly MLFF models are trained for the prototype COFs, Tp-Azo and DAAQ-TFP . We find COF structures that are initialized in an eclipsed stacking arrangement spontaneously shift to a zigzag stacking mode during MLFF-MD simulations. In contrast, the inclined structures retain their stacking throughout, suggesting that both zigzag and inclined stacking are locally stable arrangements. Using classical force fields to simulate longer time and length scales, similar, but more diverse, stacking properties are observed. These different stacking sequences in COFs lead to different radial distribution functions (RDF) and predicted XRD patterns, and we show that a zigzag motif is in best agreement with experimental observations.",
  "We outline the pipeline for our FeatureDock framework in Fig 1 . Initially, the ligand-binding pockets of protein complexes in the PDBBind v2020 refined set are discretized into grid points, embedded using 3D-invariant FEATURE representations (Fig 1A ). We then train a Transformer encoder model as shown in Fig 1C . After training, our model predicts the binding probabilities of grid points in the query pockets of a given apo protein structure, forming probability density envelopes (Fig ). Using these probability density envelopes, we designed a scoring function combined with a position optimization algorithm to predict and score the binding poses (Fig ). We will describe these steps in detail below:",

  "A free H 3 - 8 ion would have a quartet ground state, having three unpaired electrons, but in a solid the spin information will be lost when the t 2g MOs form bands by overlapping with other atoms. The H-H bond lengths in the cubes offer another perspective on the oxidation state of U; the optimized cube edge length at 150 GPa in LaH 10 is 1.231 Å, while in UH 8 it is elongated to 1.293 Å, consistent with additional electron donation into the antibonding t 2g orbitals. If a H charge is assigned to LaH 10 then the bond lengths suggest that U is in an oxidation state higher than +3, i.e. +6. This extreme formal charge separation belies significant covalency between U and H 8 .",
  "How flat and smooth are our Cu(111) foils? We have found by AFM that they have remarkably large terrace regions and that the steps are typically single-atom steps . We suggest there are possibilities for lowering the relative nucleation overpotential of our Cu(111) foils, such as: (i) altering the step density, (ii) 'decorating' the steps and/or terraces with heteroatoms (adsorbed and/or substitutional in the surface); that favor nucleating Li clusters.",

Both P3 groups of pomotrelvir and nirmatrelvir establish robust interacCons with Glu166 side chain. As commented before, these interacCons can be of interest for the design of new inhibitors, parCcularly if mutaCons in residue 166 are anCcipated as a resistance mechanism of the virus against the treatments with nirmatrelvir.",
  "For a CMS with p sensors, the overall information density is calculated based on a 'network detection matrix', a binary matrix formed by applying the boolean logical or operator across the node-specific detection matrices associated with the p search grid nodes. The binary nature of the CMS detection matrix prevents double-counting of events detected using multiple sensors simultaneously.

  "Using the examples of ordered and disordered-Li9S3N we demonstrate how the rich diversity of coordination-environment compositions creates new lithium sites and bottlenecks, enabling lowenergy-percolating diffusion pathways. In particular, we identify the composition of the bottlenecks as highly correlated with the local jump-activation energy, with nitride-rich bottlenecks favoring diffusion. Based on this observation we endeavor to maximize nitrogen content, in the process discovering a solid solution of Li2+xS1-xNx (0<x<0.55) antifluorite electrolytes reaching 0.2 mScm -1 for the maximum nitrogen composition of Li2.55S0.45N0.55.",
  "Energy terms without classical analogues (exchange plus correlation energy, which are greater than thermal energy) show quantum calculations are required. Energy as a function of voltage for a key proton transfer leads to approximately the correct voltage for channel opening. Calculated total charge transfer (not only protons) for gating is reasonable compared to experimental values. We are also able to account, at least qualitatively, for two mutations, one left shifted, one right shifted, and show the alternate proton paths that are required to account for these.",

  "To investigate this possible electron transport limitation in the thin film towards the metallic side contact independent of the sluggish OER kinetics, we employed CV in hexacyano ferrate K4[Fe(CN)6]/K3[Fe(CN)6] containing electrolyte, constituting the outer-sphere reversible redox couple Fe 2+ /Fe 3+ (in the following denoted as Fe 2+ /Fe 3+ ). To obtain the typical duck shape of the CV scan, the rotation is turned off for this experiment. In contrast to inner-sphere electrocatalytic reactions like the OER, such outer-sphere fast redox couples have no significant material-dependent kinetic charge-transfer challenges but can directly reveal electronic transport limitations. For barrier-free band alignment at all involved interfaces and a low overall resistance, one expects a reversible redox process with symmetric anodic and cathodic peaks and a small peak potential separation. Any decrease in peak height as well as asymmetries can be related towards electronic resistances in the electrode stack (or in some cases toward smaller surface areas ).",

  "In what is to our knowledge the first effort to provide such general quantitative insight, the effect of seasons on pharmaceutical removal efficancies at WWTP and pharmaceutical degradation in environment was summarised by parametrizing them with temperature. Although variation is present in all the data analysed, for IBU, DCF, and CBZ, a consistent trend of WWTP removal and environmental degradation rates increasing with temperature was present in all the results, and the numerical tools provided allow forming reasonable predictions of their average concentrations in different conditions. For SMX, the results were inconclusive, partially due to less data available.",
  "The spatio-temporal charge accumulation with time continues in a manner analogous to capacitor charging phenomena and prevents the streamers to bridge the electrodes. However, the process cannot continue for infinite time as there would be a saturation. The dispersed nanosheets gets charge saturated and can't accommodate incoming charges further. The migration of charges to CB via hopping takes place through the induced states as shown schematically in Fig. . This leads to transient generation of Schottky current and breakdown . With increasing wt. %, the number of traps increases resulting in further increase of BDV (Fig. ). But, after a critical concentration, (here 0.005 wt. % in oil 1), the inter-sheet distance in the medium decreases which causes an overlap of the interfacial zones /EDL regions of two or more sheets. This causes hindrance in electrostatic stabilization and upsurges Van der Waals forces and creates a scattering-free and resistance free escape of streamers through the EDL region . The apparent time required to trap a free charge becomes larger than the time required for a free charge to traverse the gap. Hence accumulation of carriers occurs resulting in numerous arc-discharges and ultimately the oil become conducting.",
  "As a result of their well-defined three-dimensional binding cavities, mechanically interlocked receptors have garnered significant attention in ion recognition and sensing.

Unsurprisingly, significant attention has been directed at the incorporation of various reporter groups into these interlocked ion receptors, in particular luminescent reporters.",

  "DeepSURE is a multi-modal image fusion model for MSI reconstruction at high resolution (Fig. ). The model takes a single misaligned pair of HR H&E image and LR MSI as input, and produces a SR MSI as output through learning their internal statistics and correlations between images of different resolution. DeepSURE is consisted of three different modules (Fig. ), including the registration module, mapping module, and fusion module.",
  "In designing LEDbyXample, the developers sought to build an automation-friendly system that was more flexible and lower cost than other options available, such as the openhardware Wisconsin Photoreactor platform 8 and the budget commercial Pioreactor. 9 This project's developers wanted a system that was lower-cost than Pioreactor while providing easy assembly and extensibility so researchers can modify the design and incorporate new capabilities. The relatively simple fabrication can also serve to reinforce builders' skills with prototyping electronics, 3d printing and using a microcontroller.",
  "The autocorrelation function for the La and Lb states of 3MI was found to decay within 1 ps, so it was averaged over multiple windows of 4 ps following the protocol reported previously. For the sake of comparison, we also computed the SD of 3MI in vacuum using the vertical gradient (VG) method from a normal mode analysis of the ground state and TD-DFT calculations performed at the ωB97X/6-31G(d) level of theory. The resulting SDs were broadened using a",
  "Another area of further interest concerns how to select a rule when multiple rules lead to the identical transformation. The current mmpdb heuristic is just one approach, and better ones may be developed. Database pruning represents another challenge for the platform.

  "Our stochastic titration CpHMD method derives all PB parameters from the underlying force field. However, model compound treatment maintains some theoretical vagueness regarding their molecular definition and pK a values. A site's model compound is a nonphysical fragment, representing the side chain of an amino acid. The pK a value of this model compound (pK mod ) is then calibrated using experimental data of simple systems. As previously detailed, we use the pK a values measured from NMR data on alanine-based pentapeptides, thus removing systematic errors introduced by the PB parameters.",
  "We sought to prepare a more rigidified system through restriction of the disorder typically associated with flexible alkyl sidechains at the periphery of the macrocycle. Retaining a six-carbon count in the sidechain was ideal for assembly but cyclization and planarization into an aryl ring (phenyl) would remove significant disorder. Rationalization that the aromatic sidechain would likely favor a coplanar arrangement with the carbazole and strengthen the shape-governing effect. In addition, the phenyl rings provide an opportunity for further π-π interactions that rigidify and rectify the self-assembled structure. This should make such a system suitable for diffractive analyses, such as micro-electron diffraction (µ-ED), to identify the assembly packing mode.",
  "DNA Translocation Experiments. Ionic current traces were sampled using a Chimera VC100 at 4.167 MHz. After establishing a difference in salt concentration across the nanopore, a minimum of 30 minutes was allowed to elapse before applying a voltage and recording translocation events, to ensure a time-independent I-V curve (see Section S9 of the ESM), which we attribute to the 𝜁potential of the pore walls and the ion distribution inside the pore reaching a steady state .",
  "To summarise, a concise synthesis of 13 C2-labelled phytosiderophores was accomplished by employing state-of-the-art asymmetric methodology to install the required stereocenters in high selectivities. The obtained building blocks were reacted in our previously disclosed divergent synthetic approach to furnish the target compounds in 10 or 11 steps longest linear sequence and good yields overall. These precious materials will enable collaborating plant and soil scientists to study PS secretion patterns in grass crops as well as PS interaction with the soil matrix including microbial decomposition dynamics. Detailed insights into the mechanisms of micronutrient acquisition by plants will advance the development of micronutrient rich crops which is considered a key strategy to battle wide-spread mineral micronutrient deficiencies in human populations around the globe.",

  "Optimized geometries were validated as octahedral following previously developed criteria (Supporting Information Table ). Failed calculations were resubmitted, starting from the converged geometry of another spin state where available, with preference towards a lower-spin state. Structures flagged for ligand dissociation were resubmitted via an intermediate calculation with frozen metal-ligand distances on the initial geometry before full optimization of the coordinates. We checked for other conformations of structures with Jahn-Teller or axial distortions by restarting the geometry optimization with a fixed axial metal-ligand distance and kept the lowest-energy conformer that passed the geometry checks (Supporting Information Figure ).",
  "Revision and resubmission of postlaboratory assignments were controlled using the same token system implemented in the pilot course and token trade-in requests were monitored using a Google the rubric and highlight the changes they made so they could be found easily.

  "At a lower resolution, where each protein is a spherical particle, a longer timestep of 1 ps can be used, allowing one to simulate up to 1.2 millisecond. At higher resolution, where every amino acid in a protein is represented as one bead, the time step is usually shorter, around 1 femtosecond. In an effort to improve the performance of large-scale CG MD simulations, a unique domain decomposition scheme with dynamic load balancing was implemented by Jung et al in the Generalized-Ensemble Simulation System (GENESIS) software package as an MD engine called CGDYN. The effects of the crowded environment on the stability and folding of proteins, dimer formation and fold switching 78 have been studied using CG force fields like Martini, 79 OPEP 34 and SMOG. Bazmi et al used potential functions to describe and alter proteincrowder interactions. Langevin Dynamics combined with coarse-grained models of protein G and crowders revealed how volume exclusion provides stability to all folded states. Additionally, CG MD simulations were combined with enhanced sampling methods to further explore the effects of crowded environments on protein-ligand binding and protein folding.",

The errors in the populations were found to be less than 10 -5 which is much smaller compared to the convergence thresholds discussed below in Technical Validation.

The anodic sweep between 2 to 4.3 V vs. Na + /Na 0 in Fig. indicates oxidation (3.34 V and 3.9 V) and reduction (3.2 and 3.6 V) processes that are most probably associated to the soluble vanadium species.",
  "This ultimately directs the facial selectivity (via ISC) to generate geometrically well-defined zwitterion 1 C, which leads to carbon-carbon bond formation on the same face as the HAT (Figure ). To interrogate broader trends in selectivity and reactivity, we examined the cyclization of aromatic amides 1m-s, since they display a range of yields and product selectivity. We were able to linearly correlate the isolated yields of different 4-substituted benzyl product b-lactams 1k-1s with Hammett substituent constants (Figure (i)) and a",
  "All corrosion detection microscopy discussed thus far is limited in resolution. The diffraction limit prevents achieving spatial resolutions smaller than approximately half the wavelength of light used to image a sample using conventional methods. Light focuses into a point spread function (PSF) or Airy pattern, with a central peak surrounded by rings of a diffraction pattern. The central peak width of such a pattern is typically 200-300 nm for visible microscopy, preventing resolutions below this scale and resolving individual molecules.",
  "The payload release via heterolysis from the singlet excited ( 1 S * ) state of Cy7 and related photocages follows the simplified correlation diagram in Figure . An excited state barrier separates the 1 S * minimum from its conical intersection (CI) with the ground state. At the CI, the excited state population branches toward formation of a contact ion pair (CIP) or the starting material (SM). Good nucleofuges in coumarin photocages follow the productive pathway to the CIP with >90% efficiency, that is, the branching ratio at the CI largely favors heterolysis with only small losses due to unproductive SM regeneration. The dynamics of the bond-breaking process suggests a similar scenario in all related photocage systems. However, a recombination of the primary CIP can have a detrimental effect on the ultimate payload release. In the absence of an efficient intersystem crossing, the excited state barrier and/or the ions separation from the CIP then determine Φrel.",
  "Many challenges remain to be addressed to enable EAST-compliant and MLFF-driven general molecular simulations. Among these we mention the development of data and computationally efficient semilocal interatomic interaction models , explicit treatment of (many-body) long-range interactions , building datasets with comprehensive coverage of chemical space , and development of modern GPU-enabled molecular simulation frameworks . Within this work, we take decisive steps towards solving the aforementioned challenges for organic (bio)molecules. Our solution combines recent advances from chemical and computational physics, machine learning (ML), and established techniques from the FF community. Semi-local interactions are described by the SO3krates ML model using a many-body anharmonic treatment. The physical pairwise terms include short-range Ziegler-Biersack-Littmark repulsion , long-range electrostatic interactions, and a recently derived universal interatomic van der Waals dispersion potential . Complementarity between the different terms is achieved through careful parametrization on a curated and comprehensive dataset of 4M molecular structures, leading to the SO3LR model (we suggest pronunciation \"solar\").",

  "First, a series of lateral pulling trajectories were conducted in the NpT ensemble, at T = 270 K and 310 K. We believe these to be reasonable upper and lower limits for the temperatures experienced by the hydraulic systems of most vascular plants. 270 K is substantially above the melting point of our water model (252 K for TIP4P/2005 20 ), meaning the system exhibited the correct thermal energy of supercooled water, without the risk of ice nucleation occurring within the simulation. It is also consistent with the phenomenon under study: sap present in xylem conduits can often withstand supercooling down to -10 • C before freezing. Increasingly negative pressures were applied in the xy plane, in increments of 20 ns, to induce expansion of the mean area per lipid (APL). In contrast to the pure phospholipid system investigated in our previous work, expansion of the mixed monolayer occurred relatively rapidly at both temperatures studied. More extreme pulling rates induced faster expansion and the system plateaued at a more stretched configuration relative to the starting coordinates. ns in Figure ), both monolayers lost all structural integrity and underwent runaway growth.",
  "In this study, we propose the Fragment Tree-Transformer based VAE (FRATTVAE), a model that handles large-scale and complex compounds while achieving high reconstruction accuracy and generation quality. FRATTVAE processes compounds as tree structures with fragments as nodes, facilitating the handling of stereoisomers and managing molecules with salts and solvents, which are challenging for conventional graph representations. By adopting the Transformer with multihead attentions of query-key-value type and applying a positional encoding method for tree structures, FRATTVAE resolves the sequential processing issues of LSTM used in models like JTVAE and NP-VAE, significantly enhancing molecule generation accuracy and computational speed. While existing VAE models showed significant drops in accuracy for certain evaluation metrics, FRATTVAE consistently achieved high accuracy in reconstruction and several benchmark metrics, including FCD (Fréchet ChemNet Distance), across five benchmark datasets, ZINC250K , MOSES , GuacaMol , Polymer , and SuperNatural3 with diverse molecular property distributions. In molecular optimization benchmark tasks, FRATTVAE demonstrated superior performance to state-of-the-art models. The conditional model, Conditional FRATTVAE (C-FRATTVAE), effectively generates molecules with desired properties under multiple conditions. In addition, the Transformer-based model enables GPU massive parallel computations, making large-scale processing possible. Towards constructing a large chemical model, we developed a large chemical model trained on 12 million molecules from the entire molecule datasets in ChEMBL and DrugBank databases, and PubChem10M used in ChemBERTa . The total number of parameters in the model reached 1 billion.",
  "Nevertheless, we find that 3-dimensional migration pathways are possible with tubular, adamantane and cubic cages, which are likely to yield srs, dia and pcu migration pathways. 2dimensional pathways, either hexagonal (hcb) or square planar sql, are possible with all cage shapes, and 1-dimensional simple chains may result from lantern, adamantane and tubular cages, but are unlikely to form from cubic cage molecules. Overall; adamantane, cylinder, 3-sided lantern and prism shaped porous organic cages are most likely to form crystals with intrinsic migration pathways.",

  "Briefly, the work shed light on the hidden roles of ammonium halogen molten salts presented during the thermal polymerization of g-C3N4, which essentially impacted the catalytic processes regarding enhancement. Understandably, NH4X could alter the concentration of mono and cluster carbon and nitrogen-vacancy species in the materials, helping ameliorate catalytic rates by providing trapping states. In addition, the roles of defects in optical and photoelectric properties were thoroughly studied, highlighting and reinforcing the function of defects in the materials. The production of H2O2 would be critically investigated with precise mechanisms associated with different reduction and oxidation channels in the solution.",

The computed and experimental values of CSA are compared in Figure and Table showing a good agreement and thus validating the computational approach.",
  "The arene is oxidised at the graphite anode (+2.07 vs saturated calomel electrode (SCE) for mesitylene) to produce the aryl radical cationI, according to the mechanism that has been hypothesised to operate in the electrochemical flow reactor (Scheme 12). The subsequent attack on this molecule by the nucleophilic azole can result in the creation of the new C-N bond. After losing a second proton and an electron, II will produce the radical species III by a deprotonation phase, which will eventually give rise to the azolated product32. As a synthetically advantageous consequence of the cathodic process, protons are reduced to create molecular hydrogen.",
  "Overall, a computational workflow, as shown in Figure , was applied here prospectively using the multi-state AF2 model of the unresolved inactive A3R in complex with a congeneric series of antagonists with measured Kd and RTexp values. In a second round of calculations the adjustment in the orientation of EL2 receptor residues permitted fitting of the calculated RTs with experimental values and the refined AF2 model of inactive A3R achieved also a strong correlation between calculated and experimental relative binding affinities. This computational workflow was able to accurately rank the drug molecules in a congeneric series, prioritizing the leads with stronger binding and also longer residence times. It can be used for SBDD aiming at further lead optimization in the studied congeneric series. The optimization of the homology model for example of the AF2derived model of the receptor can be achieved in the stage of the kinetic or thermodynamic binding calculations or both stages may be used. We anticipated that the computational workflow can be used for other unresolved GPCRs or other receptors.",
  "Purified protein was concentrated to 12 mg/ml and crystallized with the sitting drop vapor diffusion method at 20 °C by mixing equal volumes of protein and reservoir solution (40 % (v/v) (±)-2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD) and 100 mM 2-morpholin-4-ylethanesulfonic acid (MES) -NaOH pH 6). Crystals were directly flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen without additional cryoprotection. X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K at beamline BL14.1 at BESSY II (Berlin, Germany) 59 at 15.205 keV to record the anomalous signal of Rb + and additionally at 13.5 keV for the Ba 2+ complex. Both crystals belonged to spacegroup C222 1 with unit cell dimensions a=68 A, b=175 A-177 A, c=68 A, α = β = γ = 90°. Data process-ing and scaling was performed with XDSAPP.

  "The nine gas-phase reference structures were optimized at the PBE/def2-TZVP level and the isotropic shielding at Se as well as the (C,Se) spin-spin coupling constants were calculated for these structures. The zeroth-order relativistic approximation (ZORA) was used along with the appropriate relativisticallycontracted basis set for the property calculations. Plotting the shielding values (iso) versus the measured chemical shifts (Se) and performing linear regression yielded excellent agreement (R 2 = 0.997) with the equation Se = -0.744iso + 1220.6 (Figure ). The values predicted from this equation give a mean absolute error (MAE) of 15.6 ppm, and yielded the correct ordering of compounds from low to high predicted chemical shift. This method thus is recommended for 77 Se shift calculations of selenoureas as it has a low computational cost and high accuracy. It is also convenient to evaluate both  donor ability and  acidity of a carbene from NMR calculations of a single optimized structure. Given the large structural variety of the nine reference carbenes the model is very promising, though additional carbene experimental data would further verify its utility.",
  "Incorporating a Zn promoter into the interface structure selectively stabilises some intermediates, highlighting the importance of the effort to identify key intermediates and transition states. As Zn binds H less strongly, the role of the Cu is in hydrogen dissociation, storage, and spillover as well as enhancing CO binding. An increased understanding of promoter-adsorbate interactions allows tailoring of surface properties to influence adsorbate binding, which is important for selectivity and yield.",
  "Additionally, azetine intermediates have been proposed to result upon elimination reactions of intermediate azetidines. Faure and co-workers discussed that elimination of HBr from 142 resulted in 144, rather than the expected 2-azetine product (Fig. ). Instead, the 2-azetine is proposed to form transiently as intermediate 143, which then reacts with atmospheric oxygen to form an oxetane species that undergoes ring-opening to 144. A polymer byproduct arising from 143 was also observed, demonstrating the reactivity of this intermediate.",
  "For the folded AcAla 15 LysH + , we observe that the αhelical motifs are preserved up to 500-600 K (Fig. and Fig. ). These findings agree with experimental measurements, which observe scattering cross sections for AcAla 15 LysH + consistent with an α-helical structure up to ≈725 K when subject to interactions with the helium buffer gas . Direct comparison with gas-phase experiments would have to explicitly include the helium environment and quantum nuclear effects. Overall, the two polyalanine systems provide a good evaluation of scalability to medium-sized systems in dynamics, complementing the observed scalability in terms of test errors.",
  "Assay data -kinodata The basis for our docking dataset is publicly available assay data from ChEMBL 33, from which we source kinase activity data via kinodata. The kinodata pipeline in short: A list of 473 protein kinases is assembled by cross-checking other widely recognized sources on kinases. Next, bioactivity measurements for these kinases were obtained from ChEMBL via Uniprot IDs. The resulting data was filtered following the steps suggested by Kramer and colleagues. The resulting set consists of experimental activity values for 211 607 kinase-ligand assay pairs, including K i , K d , and IC 50 values. For training we used the Adam optimizer with learning rate 0.001 on batches of size 64 for 200 epochs. The training objective was the mean squared error loss function. We performed this training once on a random train-test split with a test set size ratio of 0.2 and finally for the full dataset. The model is used to filter the dataset according to these predictions.",

  "To this end, this work has introduced a quantum-inspired representation for ML specifically tailored towards the simulation of X-ray spectra. The form of the p-DOS descriptor is directly inspired by the spectral shapes within the single-particle and dipole approximations and enables, for the first time, the inclusion of explicit electronic information of the absorbing atom into structural featurisation. The p-DOS is generated within the XANESNET code and constructed from the coe cients of the non-optimised (guess) wavefunction obtained from the pySCF code and while it depends on the basis set used, we have shown that even small basis sets are able to exhibit strong performance while simultaneously converting the atomic nuclear coordinates into the descriptor at rapid rates.",

  "Following camera dark count correction, temporal fluctuations in laser intensity were removed via division of each frame by the frame modal pixel value. Spatial normalization was then performed using the median of 100 frames corresponding to the time before AuNPs are detectable. We performed no further temporal binning of our data. AuNPs were finally tracked using the python module TrackPy (github.com/soft-matter/trackpy). The contrast of individual particles was determined as the maximum modulus intensity of each tracked object. Particle contrast trajectories were then subsequently fit to FW-model using scipy.optimize to produce the final processed data.",
  "The halogen dependent product selectivity was explained by a detailed analysis of the C-H abstraction and following radical fragmentation and oxidation pathways. Proposed intermediates and the product selectivity were supported by subjecting mostly small molecule analogs to the reaction conditions.

Furthermore, despite the fact that the addition of bulky moiety resulting in compounds with high molecular weight, they showed an acceptable ADMET profile with logP and solubility in acceptable ranges, although the gastrointestinal (GI) absorption was found low. They were also found to be non-tumorigenic and devoid of cardiotoxicity as assessed by our in-house tool, 3D-chERGi ; and finally, the selected compounds did not have substructural features that allow to behave as pan-assay interference compounds (PAINS) (Table ). PAINS compounds are chemical compounds that tend to display activity against numerous targets by nonspecific interactions or by altering the results of the biological tests. Compounds containing such moieties, that are often present in PAINS compounds, could be false positive hits and in general should be removed from the designed series . Accordingly, our computational investigation provided five compounds as potential RdRp inhibitors, and more importantly suggested guidelines for optimizing compounds considering the binding site of interest, showing improved binding affinity with respect to quinadoline B. In fact, such structurebased methodology can be easily applied to other ligand-protein complexes for optimizing existing hit compounds.",

  "Density landscapes of 80M DEL Tc = 0.91 in ranking DELs by their similarity to the reference database, for example. Therefore, we compared the rankings of DELs based on their degree of similarity with ChEMBL chemical space using both \"true\" and predicted GTM maps. The rankings of DELs according to their similarity to ChEMBL remained highly consistent when replacing true DEL projection vectors with those predicted using CoLiNN (Spearman's ρ = 0.956). True, general CoLiNN predictions were deceiving with a few rare DELs, and it is still unclear why those failures happened, as these were neither the most complex nor the most \"original\" DELs (in the sense of poor BB and reaction scheme overlap with training data).

  "To calculate the binding free energies quantum mechanically, we constructed a cluster model of the active site of DMFase with the sidechains of Y399, Y440, E521, and the bound DMF and/or water. We also extracted the active site geometries from the largest cluster for each trajectory to construct quantum mechanical models for quantifying hydrogen bond strength. In this model, we retained all iron coordinating residues, the DMF substrate and coordinated water, as well as N547, E657, H519, F611, K567, Y522, and Y550. Hydrogen atoms were added to saturate any open valencies for a total of 214-220 atoms for the larger model, depending on the protonation state or variant of H519 modeled. These models were assigned charge of 0 or +1, depending on the protonation state of H519. The ferric iron center was modelled as high spin (i.e., S = 5/2) in all calculations. Density functional theory (DFT) optimizations were performed using ORCA v. 6.0.0. 48 For these geometry optimizations, we used the B3LYP global hybrid functional with the def2-TZVP basis set 52 over all-atoms paired with the auxiliary basis def2/J 53 for computational efficiency.

  "Below, we will detail two combinatoric workflows for building models where residues are classified into sets by common contact type. The third method for ranking residues involves ordering residues by the number of times each residue appears in a unique model from the Combinatoric Scheme 2 model sets (see below and SI for details). This ranking inherently favors residues with more than one type of contact interaction. In using this residue ordering, ΔG ⧧ and ΔGrxn are converged when QM-cluster model size is greater than ~300 atoms (Figure ), similar to the models designed through ranking residues by total contacts with the seed. The model with the greatest overestimation of ΔG ⧧ and endergonic ΔGrxn (236 atoms) corresponds to the addition of the positively charged residue, K144. The subsequent inclusion of the negatively charged E199 residue places the predicted free energies within qualitative accuracy, reemphasizing the point that particular care in model design must be given towards charged residues and nearby residues that counter their effective charges.",

The CM* is the logarithmic sum of the same quantity, while CSE is the sum of fractional occurrence of atom types and provides an estimate of the diversity of atom environments in the molecule. These metrics are more computationally efficient and were readily implementable in Python using RDKit 20 (See SI, Code Availability) and used for our analysis.",

  "MMGBSA study estimated the overall binding free energy to be -23.2796kcal/mol, with a standard deviation of 7.4088kcal/mol (figure )). The binding of fortunellin was mainly contributed by gas-phase interaction energy (ΔG gas ) and Vander Waal interaction energy (ΔG VDWAALS ). The residues Ser6, Pro7, Ser106, Ala108, and Ala109, in addition to the GxxxG domain residues, contributed to the observed binding energy (figure )). All of this suggests proper complex formation folding and stabilization with less dynamic mobility of the receptor and less conformational alterations to the overall enzyme structure. Thus, occupying the enzyme's interface may prevent dimerization and thus activation, affecting its functions. Thus, Fortunellin may potentially inhibit the NSP-8 activity by targeting the replicase enzyme.",
  "Hence, HL1's comparable BRD4 selective degradation efficiency to MZ1 might be attributed to its better permeability combined with equally high cooperativity for the BD2 domain of BRD4. For HL1CON with redundant hydrophobicity against permeability, its early onset of the hook-effect seems to be less relevant to the permeability since HL1CON could not penetrate and build-up intracellular concentration efficiently, but more correlated with its intrinsic low cooperativity (i.e., binary complex formation is competitive with the formation of ternary complex).",

This isomer also forms the expected optimum angle (H•••Fe-O angle 91°) for activating the π-pathway for HAA resulting in subsequent chlorination (Figure ).",
  "From such an intermediate, local changes propagate to the binding pocket, causing a reorientation of some important residues, namely Tyr165, Phe187, and Phe192 (Fig. ), up to the entire protein, resulting in a tilt of the spine. The same changes also contribute to stabilize the proton transfer from Cprop to His278, which allows the structurally heterogeneous BV found in Lumi-F to homogenize into the same Pr-like conformation. From there, the sequence of events initiating the tongue's refolding is activated, starting with the cleavage of the Arg456-Asp196-Ser462 bridge.",

The expan- sion beyond the second order involves corresponding hyperpolarizabilities of the QM center accessible by nonlinear optical spectroscopy. The ground-state dipolar polarizability can be measured by depolarized light scattering, and the polarizability change for a specific optical transition follows from Stark spectroscopy. The quadratic expansion of eqn ( ) is mostly consistent with the full matrix diagonalization and is sufficient for the present discussion.",
  "As fragment embedding techniques utilize localized orbitals to produce the bath orbitals, there are concerns about their ability to recover weak interactions, such as hydrogen bonding between molecules. Here, we evaluate the quality of the energies generated via d-DF-DMET-CCSD in terms of how well hydrogen bonding is recovered in systems containing such interactions. To achieve this, we perform numerical structural optimizations using the PyBerny program based on numerical gradients, while the all-electron DF-CCSD optimization via analytical gradients is performed using Psi4's DFOCC module. The numerical gradients are evaluated using the twopoint formula:",

Calibration was performed via injection of isolated ions (normally the MRFA peptide), scanning of TE1 and ion energy to record the loci of best resolution (minimal peak width), that indicates a first-order temporal focusing. These loci form generally a wavy line which is approximately described by a cubic function as shown in Figure , whose shape varies under different values of the parameter TE2. The optimal values of both tuning parameters correspond to zero inclination of the wavy line in the point of inflection as illustrated in Figure . Such regime generates the third-order temporal focus and provides, correspondingly, the best possible resolving power of the analyzer.",

  "The final most challenging task is to stack unit cell cubes in close packed layers by connecting chamber's openings, often three pairs at once, according to the Terrace-Step-Kink (TSK) model. Periodic organic material growth through precise covalent bonding with monomers in solution is unprecedented and significantly different from polymerization, crystals growth, or solvothermal synthesis of metal organic frameworks. The latter proceed with a low concentration of defects because of the reversible binding, unlike permanent covalent binding. Significant amount of trial-and-error work lies ahead for testing different ideas. One example is elimination of neighboring Me3Si-and CF3SO3-groups to generate triple bonds by Kobayashi's method , and connect alkynyl carbons in a cascade zipping reaction (Scheme 3). While there was no such precedent in literature, this reaction has a reasonable expectation to proceed based on the constrain of each alkyne bond position in space essential for cascade cyclization reactions. Because of the stepwise cascade mechanism, the Hückel's 4N+2 rule for concerted electrocyclic reactions does not apply in this case. P207-C168 Large chamber with achiral neck configuration (313131)^6 can be made by method 1 (Scheme 4) via beta-to-beta connection of trimers. The whole surface is chiral and chiral heptagon trimers must be used for its construction in a pure enantiomeric form. Fast racemization of propeller-like trimers with chirality defined by the torsion angle on Fig. is expected in solution due to a shallow inversion barrier reminiscent of [7]-circulene. Racemization becomes impossible when enantiomers configuration is fixed through step 2 cyclization. The chirality challenge adds up to the complexity of Schwarzites synthesis. Mixing up enantiomers violates the symmetry and makes growth in the desired direction impossible. The best strategy is to separate enantiomers after step 1 when larger fragments get higher inversion barrier, or after step 2 when racemization becomes impossible (Fig. ). A point system can quantify complexity of a synthetic design. Assigning one point for each cyclization step and one for managing chirality, the complexity index for both methods 1-2 in producing P207-C168 is three. To minimize the number of cyclization steps, a simpler method could initially join four trimers, making two sets (10a and 10b on Scheme 5) positioned at opposite corners of the unit cell cube body diagonal. Both intermediates 10ab assume spherical shapes resembling half chambers during geometry optimization via molecular mechanics. By coupling two sets the entire chamber can be formed in a single cyclization bringing the complexity index down to two. Another advantage of method 3 is the ability to control selectivity of each group of four trimers formation by varying the ratio 1a:1b. A 3:1 excess of either trimer selectively creates 10a or 10b intermediate, while methods 1-2 may suffer from competing linear oligomerization alongside cyclization.",

  "The described mechanisms driving GSS formation remain applicable to various other transition metals, albeit with some variation. In practical terms, the same fundamental principles underpinning the emergence of unquenched OAM are observed in Cu(111) and Ag(111), owing to the shared face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure and their membership in group 11. Nevertheless, due to substantial variations in their atomic SOI, only the surface of gold will exhibit GSS. In other cases, distinct crystal structures and electronic configurations of elements will yield diverse band structures, but still, a similar interplay between orbitals will govern the Rashba-type splitting on pristine surfaces of d-block elements.",

  "All computations were based on DFT using the projector augmented wave (PAW) method, plane waves (PW), and pseudopotentials (PP), as implemented in the Quantum ESPRESSO suite . The employed PPs have included scalar-relativistic and nonlinear core corrections. Due to the slab geometry, the calculations had a dipole correction added to the bare ionic potential , and since some of the adsorbates have an uneven number of electrons, all computations were spin unrestricted. The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional was used to approximate the electron exchange-correlation energy, while van der Waals (vdW) contributions to the total energy were treated using Grimme's D3 method . The PBE+D3 treatment has been used since previous reports have shown it to give dative bond energies and distances comparable with those obtained using M06-2X while providing a good description of the electronic properties of TMDs . The PW cutoff energies for the wave function and the electron density were 55 and 450 Ry, respectively. Brillouin-zone integration was performed with a Monkhorst-Pack grid of 6×6×1 . Higher cutoff and larger grids have been tested, and they had little impact on the modeled adsorption. Computations used a Gaussian broadening of 0.001 Ry since the adsorption could result in covalent bonding and thus notably affect the electronics. During total energy optimization, the positions of all atoms were relaxed with the convergence criteria of <10 -4 Ry/au for the force and <10 -5 Ry for the total energy.

Encouraged by the low activation barrier for the vdW → DB process in C 18 -pip and more importantly by the high exergonicity of the reaction, which may yield a narrow effective barrier width in accord with Hammond's postulate, we wondered if this reaction can be driven by heavy-atom quantum mechanical tunneling (QMT) even close to absolute zero.",
  "To determine conformational ensembles of selected proteins (TonBCTD, calmodulin, CDNF, MANF and EN2) with QEBSS, we ran 1 microsecond simulations from five different starting structures with five different force fields (a99SB-ILDN, DESamber, 42 a99SB-disp, 21 aff03ws, 43 a99SBws 43 ) producing a total of 25 simulations for each protein.

  "From the study of different neutralization schemes, one can conclude that the obtained capacitances depend mildly on how the system is neutralized. The modified double-layer and Donnan lagrange neutralization methods give nearly identical results while the uniform dielectric neutralization produces slightly smaller capacitances. There is an important exception, though: in the ion decrement model the neutralization method changes the overall ion distribution and therefore affects the dielectric in an unexpected way: even for the modified double-layer and Donnan method, the neutralization introduces a smooth ion density in the simulation cell. Also changes in the dielectric due to decrement exhibits an almost constant decrease instead of pronounced spatial spatial dependence. An example is shown in The interfacial potential is an important factor in electrochemical systems affecting both reaction thermody- namics and kinetics. To relate the electrostatic potential and electrochemical potential of electrons from the computational models to experimentally utilized reference electrodes, schemes from Section.II E need to be used. Instead of referencing the potential against reference electrodes, computational studies 36,37 of electrochemical systems have used PZC as an internal reference which is afterwards calibrated to the the SHE reference via the experimentel PZC on the SHE scale. The calibration value depends on the used solvent model: for models where dielectric cavity depends on the electron density as ∼ erfc[log(n(r)/n c )] such as CANDLE , VaspSOL and linear PCM , absolute SHE is calibrated be between-4.4 and -4.7V but for the soft-sphere or SCMVD type of models such a calibration is not available.",

In contrast we found important qualitative deviation between our GAP models in non-isotropic systems.

  "From prior literature, we know that at low CNF concentrations fiber entanglements prevent the formation of many hydro clusters . Above a gel crowding factor (theoretically estimated to be (N 3D = 16) an interconnected flocculated system is formed and above the rigidity threshold (theoretically estimated to be N 3D = 60) a coherent fiber floc with mechanical network strength is established. Our viscosity data comply with those observations as they collectively suggest four distinct concentration-defined regimes in the CNF suspensions. At low concentrations, the entangled fiber network is weak and can be aligned in the shear direction, while for higher concentrations hydro cluster formation resists the flow. As shown in the sample images in Figure , beyond a certain threshold concentration (≈ 0.2 wt.%), CNFs form a large cluster or floc which phase separates from the solvent at higher shear rates .",

This design combines (I) a cyclic 6-membered 1,2-dichalcogenide to select for reduction only by vicinal dichalcogenol oxidoreductases, (II-III) a cis-decalin-type architecture to boost monothiol resistance, with a piperazine backbone to boost postreduction cargo release, and (IV) a thiaselenane with a 1,2-Se,N disposition for TrxR selectivity and inertness to monothiols. We also aimed to test the generality of this cumulative design logic, by making control compounds that subvert these aspects one at a time (e.g. 1,3-Se/N probe SSeC, trans-fused SeST), or that add further performance (N-methyl piperazinamide \"P\" group in P-SeSC, a group that was found to improve both reduction and cyclisation kinetics for prior art probes (e.g. A3 vs RX1) ). The design uses PQOH as a fluorogenic cargo that is released after 5-exo-trig cyclisation onto the carbamate, then fluoresces 17 (for further design details, see Supporting Information section 1).",

  "The ranges are put into a Bayesian optimizer that uses the reaction model either with the true parameters or estimates with a certain error to find the conditions that give an optimal score for the used kinetic parameters. catalogues a comparison of optimizations using a model with the true kinetic parameters to optimizations using sets of differentials with estimated parameters. In the bottom row the yields for the found conditions put into the accurate system are also collected. We observe that the optimizations aiming to uncover a delicate maximum are accurate up to a SMAPE of at least 0.1. If parameters keep within about 10% error the proposed optimum conditions give yields that are only 1-4% off of the best value compared to the total range of possible scores. This proves this method can be used to find optima for complex systems with high accuracy despite the presence of reasonable error.",
  "Gaussian basis sets dominate the field of quantum chemistry, since all electrons can efficiently be included in the calculation, the electronic Coulomb integrals can be evaluated analytically in the Gaussian basis, 131 and the evaluation is efficient when recursion relations are used. Thanks to many decades of work on the development of Gaussian basis sets, basis sets exist for the accurate reproduction of various molecular properties at several levels of theory. Access to analytical integrals greatly facilitates the implementation of post-HF theories, and also guarantees accurate force and Hessian evaluations.",
  "To address the purity issues of the final construct, the synthesis was repeated, this time with a purification after the bsAb-formation step. FabHER2-FabCD3-N3 9 was formed as before, albeit on a larger scale to account for mechanical protein-loss during purification, and subsequently purified by SEC (Figure To further showcase the modularity of the three-protein conjugation approach developed here and to generate an additional useful construct, the synthesis of a FabCD3-FabHER2-FabPD-1-Biotin CiTE 27 was attempted (Figure showed an additional fainter band beneath the main band, however the LC-MS spectrum showed only the expected masses (with the three major peaks arising from one-amino acid variations in the precursor Fabs as discussed in the ESI).

  "Lowering the operating temperature to 150 K increases both adsorbed and gas phase hydrogen stored in each tank (Figure ), hence reducing the cost of storage tank and MOF, but requiring higher refrigeration capital and operational costs. Overall, this provides a higher LCOS compared to the 250 K case. Additionally, further decreasing temperatures reduces the number of storage tanks and the overall footprint. While 250 K can achieve a lower LCOS, the system cost benefits require more cheap type 1 storage tanks compared to 350 bar compressed gas which use fewer but more costly type 3 storage tanks due to the limited gas and solid phase hydrogen per tank. This increases footprint and the piping and balance of plant requirements between the tank networks.",
  "Computational studies of In37P20 have revealed important features that relate its reactivity and structure. Kulik and coworkers developed multiple connections between the carboxylate ligands and the surface reactivity of the InP cluster, leading to the conclusion that the bridging syn-anti binding mode is the most reactive when subjected to P 3-. Furthermore, the distance between surface In atoms is the primary descriptor that dictates their susceptibility to displacement by P , where longer separations correlate with higher carboxylate dissociation energies. Beyond the study of surface attack driven conversion, ab initio molecular dynamics calculations have been performed to better understand the initial mechanistic steps in the thermally induced conversion of clusters. Kang and coworkers identified three indium carboxylate units on the cluster surface whose release is what initiates cluster dissolution. Once again, the carboxylate network on the cluster surface is cited as the culprit for directing structural rearrangement.",
  "Other semen studies typically use sample sets in the hundreds from fertility clinic donors and programs such as LED-FERTYL . A larger sample size that still utilized the general population donors of this study would have built more confidence in results and may have provided more definitive associations between chemicals of interest and health parameters. A second limitation is the lack of quantitative information. Though HRMS is a valuable resource for identification and measurement of intensity of chemicals, the non-targeted nature of the analysis made acquisition of standards for calibration and quantification of all chemicals of interest challenging. All results are therefore relative, leaving out information about seminal and environmental concentrations.",

Electrostatic surface potential (ESP) calculations (level of theory: DFT:B3LYP/6-31G(d)) revealed the electron distribution for a bis-thianthrenation (Figure ). The electron withdrawing sulfonium cation is diminishing the electrostatic potential of its attached phenyl (neutral electrostatic potential, green). The para-phenyl group is still displaying a negative ESP (red) indicating that the electron withdrawing effect of the thianthrene does not significantly affect the adjacent phenyl ring, making a second thianthrenation feasible. On thianthrenium azulene the ESP map clearly shows a significant amount of electron density located on C(3), despite the deactivation of the thianthrenium unit on the 1-position.",

A variable working distance was used to provide an equivalent incident light intensity to the reactor of one sun (100 mW cm -2 ), unless otherwise stated. The light incident on the electrochemical cells was characterised by StellarNet Black Comet UV/vis (280 -900 nm) and Dwarf Star (900 -1700 nm) spectrophotometers, interfaced with SpectraWiz software.

Except in the microcanonical ensemble (NVEconstant number of atoms, volume, and energy) where a Berendsen thermostat was utilized, in all other cases Nosé-Hoover thermostat and barostat with damping constants of 100 fs, and 1000 fs were used to control the temperature and pressure, respectively. In all simulations, a time step of 0.25 fs was used to integrate Newton's equation of motion by the velocity-Verlet algorithm. The charge polarization effects of all atoms were included in the simulation by calculating geometry-dependent atomic charges at every time step using the charge equilibration (QEq) approach with a cutoff radii 10.0 Å for all interactions .",

  "After pulsed laser excitation, 1 shows an intense ground state bleach at 476 nm ( = -8400 M -1 cm -1 ) and four excited state absorption bands (235, 328, 375, 700 nm, see Figure ) in THF. All TA bands decay monoexponentially with a time constant of (354±3) ns (Figure ), that perfectly matches the luminescence lifetime of 1 in THF (355 ns, Table ). Using femtosecond laser pulses at 480 nm, ultrafast dynamics like the 1 MLCT 3 MLCT intersystem crossing (ISC) or vibrational cooling could not be resolved (Figure ) and can therefore be considered faster than the time resolution of the experiment (0.5 ps), similar to the fast and efficient ISC in [Ru(bpy)3] 2+ . By adding the steady state absorption spectrum in THF (Figure ) to the calibrated TA spectrum (Figure ) we isolated the pure absorption spectrum of the long-lived excited state of 1 (Figure ). The excited state features five absorption bands (Table ) that match very well with the TDDFT calculated oscillator strengths of the optimized 3 MLCT statesupporting the previous assignment of the excited state character. The nature of the electronic transitions in the MLCT state was further elucidated using a charge transfer number analysis (Figure and Table ). Compared to the 1 GS, the MLCT transitions (Mo I py2; py2 = unreduced part of the tpe ligand) in the MLCT state of 1 are blue-shifted with a band maximum at 375 nm. This is expected considering the lower electron density at the formally oxidized Mo I center. Additional lower energy bands arise from transitions involving the ligandcentered radical-anion py • (i.e. LMCT, LL'CT and LC(py • ) transitions).",
  "Based on our pressure-dependent EIS measurements, we postulate that SSB constriction impedance, attributed to Z Int in our impedance data, arises from a combination of voids and ionically-resistive surface layers. To better understand the different factors impacting constriction at the Li|LLZO interface, we modeled the impedance response of SSBs under different geometric configurations by performing FEM calculations based off work by Fleig and coworkers 29 . Additionally, we explored the connection between constriction impedance and ionic conductivity to clarify the detrimental impact of Li + /H + exchange on LLZO constriction. Figure illustrates the four distinct cases considered.",

  "Still, in periodic DFT calculations, only relatively small surface unit cells are computationally feasable, so that an infinite array of the same reaction is modelled. These reactions are usually associated with some charge rearrangement along their reaction path. This causes a change of the local dipole moment, which in an periodic presentation of these reactions alters the work function of the electrochemical interface and thus also the corresponding electrode potential .",
  "For modeling of spherical LNPs coated with various polymers, the three available end structures published by Trollmann and Böckmann (41) (simulation lengths: 240, 445 and 456 ns) for the full, unloaded Comirnaty® vaccine, prior to pEGylation, were used as starting point for running three individual replicas per polymer type (Table ). Solvent was removed and lipids conjugated via a triazole linker with either linear pEG, pMeOx, pEtOx or pMeOzi of the same molecular weight (corresponding to 45, 23, 20 and 20 monomers respectively) were inserted and aligned to the coordinates of the unpEGylated ALC-0159 lipids via PyMOL . After alignment, the original ALC-0159 molecules (conjugated with only two EG monomers) were deleted. The resulting structure was then re-solvated with TIP3P water and a sodium chloride concentration of 150 mM, removing all solvent molecules placed within the LNP and keeping a 1.2 nm minimum distance of the solute to the cubic box border. To fix all clashes introduced by insertion of lipopolymers into the equilibrated monolayer, systems were then subjected to multiple short energy minimizations (applying a soft-core potential in the beginning as described in ) and simulation runs with 1 fs time steps that were gradually increased to 2 fs. All systems were further investigated for correction of potential ring penetrations of the initally inserted lipids with nearby CHL molecules. Initial equilibration was repeated once upon re-solvation into smaller boxes after polymers condensed onto the surface after several tens of nanoseconds.",
  "If we hope for massive, automated reaction discovery through generated reaction networks, as opposed to expensive full dynamical treatment, we first need to develop an understanding of the scope of nonstatistical reactivity.

  "Only at 100% silver nitrate amount, higher metal percentage was achieved. Indeed, the XRD analysis of Ag32Cu8@CALB hybrid showed the formation of silver phosphate as metal species by an almost 90% exchange of Cu 2+ by Ag + (Figure ).

  "There has been an important recent advancement in ML models predicting an effective Hamiltonian. This approach can indeed be seen as cleverly parameterizing tight-binding DFT Hamiltonians, similar to semi-empirical methods (see Section 5.1).

Later, Unke et al. developed an ML model that recovers an effective Fock matrix in a minimal basis, dubbed as SchNOrb . Upon diagonalization, the wavefunction is produced, as well as energies, forces, and other molecular properties. None of the two models above incorporate equivariance. Work by Nigam et al. as well as PhiSNet built on that success by leveraging equivariant ML techniques to reduce the training process and show enhanced accuracy and efficiency.

The oxidation-state changes are similar as well with both Fe 3+ cations in the Fe-O-Fe dimer oxidized to Fe 4+ during the potentialdetermining step. In general, the investigation of the axial pathway for both types of surfaces showed that isolated monomers tend to have higher OER overpotentials than dimers (when all surface-attached group atoms are Fe), in agreement with experimental TOFFe trends. Beyond dimers, larger surface Fe-oxo clusters, as compatible with EXAFS analysis, may further stabilize the potential-determining intermediate by spreading oxidative charge over multiple Fe sites.

  "By 2012, new work emerged regarding the definition of pH in RM water pools. Crans and Levinger called out the breakdown of the thermodynamic concept of pH in pools containing less than 10 0 waters. Bal et al. raised the issue that within nm-scale biological cell components, solution pH is not defined in a conventional sense because the pools are too small to support consistent water ion concentrations near neutral pH. More recently, Silverstein explored this point further, interpreting the non-integer average values of expected protons 10 in neutral solution in terms of a Poisson statistics model for random placement of finite numbers of persistent protons in a collection of small pools. This statistical model was previously developed by Shon and Cohen, and used to quantify the presence or absence of DNA in aqueous solutions confined to volumes of 8 × 10 \"0 to 2.6 × 10 \"+ 𝑝L.",

At each active learning iteration, unique configurations are selected based on the similarity check and boosting configurations by adding random noise displacement. The energy of generated new configurations is calculated using a physics-based model and is incorporated into the training in the following active learning iteration.

The Fe-S1N3 configuration exhibits exceptional selectivity with CO Faradaic efficiency of 99.02 % and activity with TOF of 7804.34 h -1 , as well as remarkable stability during CO2 reduction reaction . The distorted 1T MoS2 induced by lattice strain and Co-S bond formation between Co1 and MoS2 achieved Pt-like activity toward HER and high long-term stability . As the applied potential varies from 0.00 to -1.00 V versus RHE, the as-synthesized Cu-N4 structure underwent successive transformations from Cu-N3 to near-free Cu 0 single atoms and eventually to aggregated Cu 0 nanoparticles. Concomitantly, the ammonia production rate was steadily enhanced until the maximum of 4.5 mg cm -2 h -1 (12.5 molNH3 gCu -1 h -1 ) with a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 84.7% was reached at -1.00 V versus RHE. Despite the promising achievements and accelerated experimental progress, there is still a strong desire to gain deeper insight into the origin and dynamics of the efficient ADC to devise efficient catalysts as one wishes. Theories such as d-band center shift , nano-confinement , interfacial charge transfer , frontier orbitals , selective orbital coupling , and steric hindrance for pairing adatoms have been developed and elegantly used. Among the known possible mechanisms, the d-band center theory correlates the catalysis efficiency directly to the extent of the d-band shift.",

  "The mechanism of styrene hydrogenation is believed to start by cathodic reduction of 27 and subsequent protonation delivering a benzylic radical which undergoes the same process again to furnish products 28 (Scheme 3c). The difference in Qiu's concept is that the radical anion of TPPO ( ) transfers an electron to styrene 27 which then leads to intermediates of the direct pathway. The mediator TPPO (29) formed is in situ by anodic oxidation of TPP (30), a molecule which unlikely acts as a reductive mediator. The authors declare TPP (30) as the mediator and only clarify its role in the mechanistic part which concludes their manuscript we find this misleading especially to readers unfamiliar with mediated electrolysis. It is also surprising that Qiu's screening led to slightly reduced yields when TPPO ( ) is directly used (73% to 70%). Qiu's deuteration is described as an \"electrochemical deuterium atom transfer (eDAT)\", to us this renaming is a deceptive way to elevate an already established concept. The strong mechanistic similarity to direct reductions implies that previously reported reactions are also \"eDATs/eHATs\". The presented mechanistic comparison showcases also for this reaction that the core mechanistic concept remains the same no matter if direct or mediated SET occurs.",

  "Our strategy focused on providing flexibility for modular access to all known 5/5-spiroindimicin family members as well as later analogue preparation (Scheme 1B). We envisaged fragment couplings wherein each of the 3 heteroaromatic units might be easily varied, leading back to simple isatin (25), pyrrole (24), and indole (22) building blocks. Retrosynthetically, this led us to trace back generalized structure 18 to its C-2′-oxo analogue 19, which in a forward sense would be transformed to the natural products through chemoselective reduction of the oxindole to indoline in the presence of the methyl ester(s). Spirocycle 19 was seen to arise through a Friedel-Crafts cyclization of C-2″ of the pendant indole ring onto a C-3′-cation formed via acidmediated ionization of tertiary alcohol 21, a step that was projected to be challenging due to the high degree of strain engendered in newly formed 5-membered ring containing 4 sp 2 carbon atoms. Triaryl compound 21, which encompasses all 3 aromatic fragments of the natural products, might arise through two key C-C fragment couplings: a chemoselective Suzuki crosscoupling between indole boronate 22 and oxindole-pyrrole halide 23, itself available through addition of highly functionalized pyrrolemetal species 24 to the ketone of isatin 25.",
  "At this stage, we aimed to functionalize the 7-membered ring via regioselective desaturation. Ketal deprotection under standard acidic conditions gave ketone 24 without affecting the spiroketal. Regioselective enolization of 24 with LiHMDS formed an enolate, which could be reacted with Mukaiyama's reagent 25 to deliver vinylogous lactone 26 in 36% yield. No regioisomeric enone was observed under these conditions; we speculate that simple steric differentiation may be a key factor in the selective α-deprotonation at C-2 (C-2 is one atom further from quaternary C-6 compared to C-4). Attempted O-methylation of ketone 26 led instead to ring-opening (see 28, X = O) via preferential deprotonation of the isoxazoline ring at the a-imino C-7 position. Aiming to leverage this observation, we targeted prior installation of C-7 oxidation. Unfortunately, attempted oxidation of spiroisoxazoline units in 23 or 24 proved challenging. We found that attempted deprotonation to the aza-enolate and trapping with a range of oxidants/electrophiles did not afford a C-7 functionalized product. Attempts at radical-or transition metalmediated functionalizations, including directing group-based strategies (30 → 31), were similarly unsuccessful. We routinely obtained ring-opened products (e.g., 28) even at low temperatures (-78 °C and below), pointing to the strain inherent in the oxepane ring and the driving force for aromatization to the isoxazole.",

  "The synthesis of iodide 12 began with two step conversion of methyl angelate (30) into angelic aldehyde, which was found to be configurationally labile (Scheme 1B). Therefore, after preparation, it was always immediately used in a Still-Gennari olefination with phosphonate 31 to give dienoate 32, which was subsequently reduced with DIBAL to give allylic alcohol 20. We were surprised that despite their apparent simplicity, neither 32 nor 20 are previously described compounds. Sharpless asymmetric epoxidation of 20 proceeded in excellent yield to give 33, but with modestenantioselectivity (81% ee), as has previously been observed with Z-configured allylic alcohols. Synthesis of emeriones A-D While Upjohn oxidation of epoxide 33 to give triol 19 was moderately diastereoselective (72:28 dr), Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation (SAD) with AD-mix  proceeded with an improved diastereomeric ratio of 86:14. Moreover, due to reagent control in the SAD reaction, 19 was isolated with a slightly increased enantiomeric excess of 86% (Scheme S1). Acid-catalyzed isomerization of unprotected triol 19 proceeded with inversion of stereochemistry at C5 to give tetrahydrofuran 34, which contains the appropriate vicinal anti-diol configuration for epoxide formation. After numerous attempts to avoid cumbersome protecting group manipulations while advancing 34 to aldehyde 17 (Scheme S2), we hypothesized that the epoxide ring in 17 could be formed via oxidation of an acetal like 18. We found that acetal formation was facile: treatment of triol 34 with 4-bromobenzaldehyde (35) under acidic conditions with trimethylorthoformate as a dessicant gave 36, whose absolute and relative configuration was confirmed via X-ray crystallography.",

  "barrier between the two minima, even in the biased free energy surface, the actual sampling histogram (in yellow) of the orange Node may be located in a single minimum instead, resulting in non-ergodicity.

Hence, while these simulations may be both confined and overlapping, and while the WHAM equations converge, the actual sampled histograms will be inconsistent with the histogram predicted from the final WHAM equations. This ergodicity issue can be solved by simply increasing the umbrella bias strength κ for this Node (further confining the simulation, eliminating other free energy minima in the biased simulation), or further enhancing the sampling through, e.g., replica exchange methods.

Light induced LMCT then resulted in C-H oxidation by the catalyst coordinated oxygen and subsequent C-C cleavage reactions. Carboxylic acids were predominantly isolated, and CO2 was identified as undesired overoxidation product which was increasingly formed at prolonged reaction times. A large variety of conventional plastics -PS (Table , entry 8), PP, PVAc, HDPE, LDPE, PVC-were successfully degraded using this method and produced formic acid and acetic acid in combined yields of 9-66%.

Larger scale reactions on gram scale were also successful using a photo flow reactor.",
  "With the in-depth knowledge of the mechanism responsible for the NO x -TMD interaction, one can leverage the layer compositionadsorption relationships in order to obtain gas sensor with well tailored sensitivity and recovery. Moreover, the various responses of the different sheets allow for enhanced specificity of detection, addressing a key limitation of semiconductor sensors . This is of considerable importance, as the latter often respond to multiple species, distinguishing between which can be difficult. Such cross-sensitivity can lead to false positives or negatives, undesirable in gas detection.",

(% novel, unique, and valid).",
  "Compared to the highest score docking pose of A17 in which the pyrazolo 1-NH and anilino NH groups of the ligand forms hydrogen bonding interactions with amide side chain carbonyl of N250 , the docking calculations did not produce for A17 a binding pose in which a bidentate hydrogen bond is be formed between the N6 and exocyclic N7 nitrogen atoms and the amido side chain of N250 . Nevertheless, we produced this binding pose manually and ran 300ns-MD simulations. We observed that A17 quickly moved away (by 7 Å) from the starting docking pose (Figure ), because of the 5-cyano group pointing towards the side chain of L246 which generated Pauli repulsions between the trimethoxy-phenyl group and the upper part of the receptor, while there was no hydrophobic group to anchor the ligand to the bottom of the binding site.",
  "To remain consistent with , we sample 10, 000 latent vectors from N (0, I) and decode over 5 separate runs and record the mean and standard deviation across all runs for each metric in Table . Notably, we set a new SOTA in the validity w/o check metric at 98.28±0.06%. Across all other metrics our β-CVAE and β-VAE remain competitive with other models, falling short of the best scores in most cases by less than a few percentage points.",
  "For many machine learning applications, particularly those in which poor predictions can be costly, it is desirable to not only have aggregate accuracy metrics but to also estimate the reliability of each prediction. This allows expert decision makers to segment predictions by confidence and potentially act only on those that pass a quality threshold. To enable this, in addition to the structure prediction model we trained a separate confidence model that predicts the Tanimoto similarity between the MS2Mol predicted structure to the ground truth structure.",
  "After 5 minutes of reaction recording a frame is analysed using this method. A mask is applied to isolate the reaction solution, a colour conversion from RBG to HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) is applied and largest representative Hue value is returned. A Hue value above 160 in all cases seen have been precipitates. This method is highly reliable and saves a great deal of time running the platform long term. Simple python commands are used to perform and report on the reactions to a network.",
  "In this manuscript, a global optimization workflow for surface adsorbates was presented and tested on important reaction intermediates for ethanol synthesis on Rh(111) and (211) surfaces. The workflow is applicable to any kind of adsorbate-surface system, since no assumption about surface sites or binding motifs are made. To achieve high computational efficiency, a GAP surrogate model is used to explore the potential energy surface. Importantly, this model is iteratively trained during the MH simulations, achieving high-data efficiency.",
  "The proposed scheme was used to train an embedding model based on DFT reference calculations of molecules in QM7 dataset. This resulted in a generic model, suitable to predict embedding energies of arbitrary neutral molecules consisting of H, C, N, O and S in their ground state geometries. The model was tested by predicting QM/MM embedding energies of the non-covalent complex formed by SARS-CoV-2 main protese with PF-00835231 inhibitor. The predictions for embedding energies were more precise than those obtained from semiempirical Hamiltonians, while being ≈ 15 times faster.",

We optimized representative configurations from dynamics with QM/MM using large QM regions (i.e., over 240 atoms) that incorporate essential protein residues (e.g., HB-forming Ala82) not included in prior computational studies of WelO5 (see Sec. 5 and Supporting Information Tables ). In contrast with prior studies, we include additional protein residues within 4.0 Å of 12-epi-fischerindole U, such as Asn74 and Val81, in our QM regions to detect any HB interactions that could have otherwise gone undetected with geometric criteria or classical interaction analysis from MD.",

  "To assess the enhanced utility of integrated OMSLs for annotation tasks, we analyzed chemical fingerprints from Arabidopsis thaliana using MS-Dial. The annotations were performed independently on each OMSL as well as on the integrated dataset processed through the FragHub workflow.

We compared yolk content and the number of quantifiable proteins in the D11 clone of the X. laevis neurula using a standard shotgun workflow (control) and YODEC applying 4 times carrier load than the analytical channels. To compare with the proteome carrier approach, we also measured the sample after mixing it with its barcoded self as the carrier proteome (without yolk depletion). As presented in Figure , the carrier approach maintained high yolk content and disadvantaged protein quantification similar to the control, whereas the YD carrier effectively diluted yolk to improve protein quantification using YODEC.",

  "The greater intensity of the interband transition in the annealed samples allowed Tauc band gaps to be determined even in the presence of IVCT. As shown in Table , the band gaps appeared unchanged within error in the Sn doped material. One of the reasons for the failure of mixed-valent Sn doping into MA3Bi2I9 may come from the structural difference between MA3Bi2Br9. Compared to 2D layered material MA3Bi2Br9, which has a trigonal crystal structure with the space group P-3m1 crystal structure, the positions of Bi atoms in the 0D MA3Bi2I9 lattice possesses monoclinic crystal structure with the space group C12/c1 were different. Alternatively, there may be important chemical differences between I and Br which prevent Sn doping into its iodide. Further investigation on theoretical calculations using density functional theory (DFT) can be done to reveal reasons in electronic aspects.",
  "We then showcase an application of the aforementioned predictive models, trained on both representations, to de novo molecular design via Bayesian optimization. Using two generative models based on SMILES and SELFIES respectively, we find that the active site representation, with its parsimonious description of the structure, speeds up the generation of binding ligands without sacrificing the performance in terms of pIC50 reported for BindingDB's closest ligand to the generated molecules. While our molecular generation experiments focused on single-property optimization, the Gaussian process framework can be readily applied to simultaneous multi-objective optimization. Indeed, this composition problem is much more challenging than single property optimization and most works on GPs for molecular optimization focused on single properties 56,57 . But it was shown that multiobjective optimization can be efficiently addressed with particle swarm optimization .",

  "The non-covalent binding free energy of the inhibitor to M pro was calculated by the Protein Dipoles Langevin Dipoles method in its linear response approximation (PDLD/S-LRA-2000) using a sampling of 4 different configurations collected at every 20 ps of successive MD relaxation. This method, implemented in the MOLARIS-XG package, efficiently computes binding energies by constructing proper thermodynamic cycles, as detailed in our previous work. The PDLD approach represents water molecules semi-macroscopically as Langevin dipoles. The energy is evaluated using the linear response approximation, which averages the charged and uncharged states. The entire system is embedded within a 20 Å simulation sphere centered around the Nirmatrelvir inhibitor and surrounded by a bulk continuum. The electrostatic energy was scaled using a dielectric constant of ε = 4 for the protein, and the non-electrostatic term, which is not specific and may vary by system, was scaled by a factor of 0.75 and is detailed in Ref .",

  "We discover presence of chemical inductive effects in phase separating ion intercalation energy storage materials, specifically in lithium iron phosphate (LFP) and also lithium titanate oxide (LTO). These materials features fast (de)intercalation and slow diffusion relaxation phenomena which are prerequisites for observing such inductive effects. Presented finding is supported by the mechanistic model and analytical reasoning indicating that all equilibrium states that lay inside the miscibility gap of the phase separating material exhibit strong inductive response in the low frequency part of spectrum. We also explain why such inductive effects are not observed outside the miscibility gap. This letter presents the first mechanistic reasoning of previously reported electrode level experimental observation of inductance during impedance measurements at low currents.",

  "Häse et al. developed the Bayesian optimizer Phoenics 295 that addressed the issue of large numbers of samples required for chemical global optimization tasks, particularly where evaluation of a point in chemical design space is costly. By utilizing an autoencoder-like BNN for kernel density estimation from observations, a surrogate function can be constructed with higher efficiency. Phoenics was benchmarked on a reduced Oregonator model for the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction, and, when compared to RF, GP, PSO, and CMA-ES, Phoenics outperformed the other methods after only 25 evaluations. Later on, an extension of Phoenics with a particular focus on handling categorical variables. Additionally, Gryffin considers the correlation among the variables through the use of descriptors; for example, the physicochemical descriptors of selectable solvents. Among multiple optimization strategies and packages such as PyEvolve, 297 SMAC, HyperOpt, and GPyOpt, 300 the authors reported the best performance with the Gryffin optimizer. Other chemistry specific BO algorithms include Gemini, which extends Gryffin to multi-fidelity optimization, Golem, which identifies optima that are robust to input or measurement uncertainties, and Anubis, 302 which incorporates unknown experimental constraints into the acquisition function.

Upon treatment with PhBr at room temperature in THF-d8, 1 was fully consumed within minutes. However, Ni(III) products were not formed, and 1 H NMR instead revealed the formation of a 1:1 mixture of ( CO 2 Et bpy)Ni(Ph)(X) and ( CO 2 Et bpy)NiX2 (eq. 1; X = Cl or Br). While this may proceed through the intermediacy of Ni(III) (vide infra), this overall process constitutes a formal bimetallic oxidative addition similar to prior reports. We note that only 0.5 equivalents of PhBr are consumed per Ni center, even when excess PhBr is added.",

This model, combined with the time-dependent Born-Oppenheimer approximation method, enhances computational efficiency by calculating transition probabilities from the energy gap between different electronic states.

  "Both the methods mentioned above require a large computational cost if hm require frequent retraining. Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) is the most recent modification of the gradient boosting algorithm. Apart from GBDT, it adds gradient-based one-sided sampling (GOSS) and elusive feature bundling (EFB) which reduces the overall computational cost. It is nearly 20 times faster than conventional GBDT. Random Forest makes an ensemble of DTs, each of them capable of a prediction but all the outcomes are pooled (taking the mean in case of regression) for final prediction While RF does a bootstrapping of datasets and gives an aggregated output. The base learner is the DT. Each time a row sampling (some examples are taken) and column sampling (some features are taken), which is basically called bagging takes place with replacement, and they are fed to a DT and output is evaluated.",

Initial ground state wavefunctions are generated from the QuantumEspresso Density Functional Theory (DFT) package. LFSO possesses local magnetic moments with no long range order at room temperature, and consequently spin-polarized calculations (which account for these moments) prove to be essential when modeling the O K-edge XAS (Supplementary Discussion 6, Fig. ).

  "The electrochemical effects of crack formation are apparent in the context of these in situ EIS data in Fig. , although these measurements were on different cells and thus cannot be directly correlated. The vertical channel crack network and the interfacial cracks are likely the major contributors to the increasing impedance observed during delithiation. While most silicon domains within enclosed channel cracks can still participate as active material during delithiation, current constriction occurs at the edges of these regions of lost contact. Current constriction is known to exacerbate impedance increases because of locally high current densities. The relithiation process involves rapid crack closure near the LPSC interface, which likely reduces current constriction effects and correlates to the fast decrease in interfacial impedance visible in Fig. during second cycle lithiation.",
  "For the optimizations of the individual parameter groups with respect to the mean absolute error (MAE) for their corresponding training sets, I employed a simple Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm, since it is robust and does not require the calculation of training set MAE gradients with respect to the parameters. In contrast to other functionals with a larger number of empirical parameters, this does not cause major issues in the optimization procedure, since at most four parameters are optimized simultaneously within the individual optimizations. The optimization threshold for the super-SCF procedure was set to 1% change with respect to the parameter values. Apart from the optimization procedure, which is done using an in-house Python program, all calculations have been performed with a development version of the Raqet program package. The group of valence parameters comprises the cat-LMF valence parameter cv, the GGA exchange correction parameter c slx as well as the same-and opposite-spin correlation parameters css and cos, respectively. As training set, a combination with same weighting of DBH24 transition barrier heights with updated references from ref. 70 and G2-1 atomization energies with references from Haunschild an Klopper 72 is employed. In fact, from an efficiency and accuracy point of view this is a good compromise between the rather small AE6BH6 73 set used in previous works and the combination of the W4/08 74 and BH76 test sets used in the development of LH23pt.

  "The conduction band minimum (CBM) lies at Γ, forming an overall indirect fundamental band gap, though a direct transition from the VB is available at Γ, around 0.5 eV lower in energy than at E. The local dispersion around the CBM is also substantial along all 3 cell dimensions (towards Z, B and Y2), indicating the possibility for low eletron effective masses as well. This arises from its purely La d character -the partial charge density demonstrates that the La atoms form a highly directional σ-bonding network between each one another, which can then extend in all 3 dimensions. As above, the primary features appear unchanged between HSE06 and PBE0, and the only difference being a widening of the band gap by 0.62 eV.

The final ASA score is a scaled version of the KL-Divergence between these parent and perturbed pKa distributions (see Methods). Importantly, we anticipate that, with careful feature-set selection, this replace-rescore-compare scheme will generalize well to substructure-and pharmacophorelevel perturbations (Figure ).",
  "Presented results and analytic derivations clearly indicate that phase separating nature of the LFP is of the crucial importance for its behaviour as the chemical inductor. The reason for chemical induction to exist in such a system namely arises from a significant difference between the characteristic times for fast lithium (de)intercalation and slow in-plane diffusion that stabilizes phase boundaries. In a similar system without phase separation, no slow stabilizing diffusion process would take place during EIS analysis, which removes the long relaxation time scale of the system, as presented in Figure . Figure thus clearly shows that for the case of lithiation levels outside miscibility gap (lithiation levels 0.05 and 0.95) the system exhibits capacitive nature at low frequencies instead of inductive nature due to absence of phase separation.",

Only mathematics, computer science and computer science and arts/humanities received lower attention than chemistry.",
  "Results in Table show that DMSO was the most effective solvent for micronized CytroCell cellulose. PolarClean and biobased cyrene were selected due to their excellent sustainability profile, largely superior to that of DMSO, whose use should be reconsidered due to significant changes on cardiac and hepatic microtissues lately discovered . Furthermore, neither PolarClean nor cyrene interfere with the photopolymerization reaction.",
  "Specimens from Al-Cu-CP composites were aged at 4 h for wear resistance test. The test atmosphere was maintained at room temperature and relative humidity. The specimens were cold mounted for easy handling during the wear resistance test. The loads considered were 5 N, 10 N, test. Adhesive wear resistance test was then performed on the specimens. Pin-On-Disc wear test with different applied loads and constant time of 10 minutes.",
  "Since the first two fullerene reductions occur positive of the first reductions of Cage 4+ , it was possible to spectroscopically observe host-guest complexes of the singly and double reduced fullerenes in the 4+ charged host. The complex C60@Cage 4+ was reduced via two sequential 1 equiv additions of Cp*2Co, resulting in the appearance of characteristic absorbances for the C60 monoand di-anions between 800-1200nm (Figure ). Similarly, sequential 1e -reductions of C70@Cage 4+ with Cp*2Co produces spectra that display absorbances consistent with those of C70 - and C70 2-(Figure ). The Soret band and Q-peaks of Cage 4+ remain unchanged in these spectra, confirming that the host is unreduced and that its electronic properties are not influenced much by hosting the fulleride anions.",
  "The theoretical and experimental outcomes reported in this communication provide a new complementary way to describe EVs. In particular, they identify a switch diameter, located at about 200 nm, below which the EVs are composed by more membrane (surface) than luminal (bulk) proteins, and above which the partition is reversed and become, reaching predominance of luminal proteins (> 80 %) in EVs with a diameter larger than 800 nm. The model is successfully tested to Figures",
  "In we used ML methods to train models with data from the kMC simulator. However, here the ML approach is universal, which allows to model the polymerization processes not only based on the simulated results, but also on laboratory experiments. We successfully predicted polymer and process properties such as monomer concentration, molar mass averages, reaction time, MMD, using ML decision tree ensemble methods such as random forest, XGBoost, and CatBoost. These results can be successfully used in this study for the PRE problem.",
  "In general, this supports previous findings that (meta)-GGA methods should be avoided in TD-DFT. The MAEs also show a more pronounced improvement with the inclusion of RS, which is unsurprising for these CT excitations. This is again in agreement with previous studies showing that RS is essential for calculating CT and other long-range excitations. Overall, the best dispersion-uncorrected method for the CT exciplexes is SOS-ωB88PP86 with a MAE of 1.04 kcal mol -1 .",
  "Photoelectron spectra for each time delay are acquired for over 10 6 shots for Ado, 600,000 shots for AMP, and 650,000 shots for Ade. Because photoelectrons from the liquidand gas-phase water are obtained simultaneously in addition to the solute pump-probe signals, the light-induced shift of the liquid peak relative to the static gas peak position is monitored in the experiment (see Section 3-b for more details).",
  "where c(τ) was taken as the reported effluent concentration at an undetermined τ. In this form, the collected efficiencies were used to assess a specific WWTP process on an equal footing with the rate constants of Eq. ( ). We remind that the removal degree η (as well as k and r) can be negative in cases where backward reaction has taken place. That is, pharmaceuticals entering in a conjugated form can escape the detection in influent samples but emerge later in effluent samples after microbial deconjugation.",
  "The potential energy profiles of the low-lying electronic state for the canonical A-U are shown in Fig. . There are two competing mechanisms that can lead to internal conversion to the ground state. On the right side of the plot, the potential energy cuts along the amino N-H distance indicate a decay path LE/CT and CT/S 0 crossings via EDPT process. Although the barrier for this process exceeding 1 eV is most likely exaggerated due to interpolation, the CT state is apparently inaccessible from the lowest bright states. However, considering the substantial oscillator strengths of the S 9 and S 11 states that have a leading CT 1 ππ * contribution with the admixture of LE 1 ππ * configurations in the FC region, they could be directly populated by UV-C pulse well below the ionization potential of the nucleobases. This possibility of a direct population of the repulsive CT state could be interesting in the context of the prebiotic chemistry of nucleotides.",
  "Another example came from Xiong et al. , who screened an in-house 30M-member DEL against TIGIT and then employed ML to identify TIGIT inhibitors. In this study we performed the first systematic analysis comparing three different DNA-encoded libraries (DEL) and five different machine learning models in a DEL+ML pipeline (Fig. ), to identify novel binders to two paralog proteins (CK1𝛼/). The results provided a better understanding of how different DEL library sizes and inter-library diversity of DEL molecules as well as different ML algorithms influence hit discovery.",
  "Triplet-triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA-UC) offers the potential to fulfil these criteria . During TTA-UC, photo-excitation of a donor species results in the sensitization of triplet states on acceptor molecules. Subsequent annihilation of two triplets yields an excited singlet state of approximately twice the triplet energy which can fluoresce, giving upconverted emission .",
  "(refcode: BUNQAC) exhibits a similar DESP to the Rh center in the +1 net charge complexes with refcodes AFAZUE or HUVNIW. Moreover, the relative ESP of these TMCs (i.e., AFAZUE < HUVNIW < BUNQAC) is preserved upon encapsulation, emphasizing the relatively uniform impact of encapsulation on this diverse set of TMCs. These trends are largely maintained when the implicit solvent dielectric is changed from methanol to water, although small differences arise when the change in solvent impacts the optimized geometry (Supporting Information Figures ).",
  "The setup was enclosed and continuously purged with dry nitrogen gas to eliminate absorption from atmospheric water vapor. Three measurements of twenty-thousand waveforms were taken and averaged at cryogenic (LN 2 ) temperature. These waveforms were zero padded by adding 8000 points to both ends (16000 total points) and subjected to a Hann function. The timedomain data were Fourier transformed to yield a frequency-domain power spectra. Each sample was divided by a respective reference PTFE pellet spectrum to yield a frequency-domain spectrum with a bandwidth of 20-120 cm -1 . The spectra presented are a result of three averaged absorption spectra.",
  "The application of REPP instead of a kMC simulator is advantageous, since the process is expected to be faster and may be modified for more complex output structures. Various global optimization techniques, genetic algorithm, particle swarm, improved ant colony, artificial bee colony and differential evolution algorithms, allow finding alternative conditions in the REPP task . As a simple solution, we use ML for initial solution of reverse engineering problems. Furthermore, various optimization methods and heuristics can be applied to find an optimal solution, which satisfies the given criteria, conditions and restrictions.",
  "Graph-based models, on the other hand, can explicitly handle molecular structures. Models like the Constrained Graph VAE and Junction Tree VAE (JTVAE) ensure the validity of molecules by sequentially generating graph structures. Representing molecules as graphs with fragment nodes prevents the generation of invalid structures and reduces the graph size compared to atomic units, thereby shortening learning and generation times. The Non-Autoregressive Graph VAE managed datasets containing relatively large molecules like GuacaMol by reducing molecular graph sizes through treating common small substructures as single nodes. Moreover, diverse models such as the Principal Subgraph VAE (PSVAE) , which automatically discovers key substructures from datasets, and MoLeR , integrating molecular generation at both atomic and fragment levels, have been proposed. MoLeR demonstrated high performance on molecular optimization benchmark tasks.",
  "We also observed that increasing the size of the locally ergodic training datasets allows for a systematic reduction of the analytical error bars, retaining free energy estimates consistent with the ground truth and avoiding overfitting. This observation underscores the value of using validation data when computing free energy from reweighted PGMs, systematically confirming observations that were episodically reported in prior literature.",
  "of LISCO for bigger organometallic complexes involving transition metals. First, the monometallic Fe(II) complex has been optimized in its singlet state. Later, from that geometry, the same system has been optimized in the triplet and quintet states. Thereafter, single-point energies are calculated for all spin states for each geometry. Similarly, to obtain the potential energy cuts (PECs) along a particular mode, the first few low-lying excited states have been acquired for each spin state from their respective geometries with TD-DFT method with the TPSSh/Def2-TZVP level of theory.",

In contrast with other vaccines, such as live attenuated COVID-19 vaccines, to regain their toxicity due to mutation",
  "In light of the functional group compatibility afforded by this novel reaction condition, a series of validation experiments were conducted prior to its application in generating DNAencoded libraries centered on the isocoumarin scaffold. Initially, Suzuki coupling was executed with DNA-tagged com-pound 4a. Analysis via LCMS revealed the predominant product has a molecular weight of proposed product plus 18 Da, indicative of lactone hydrolysis product 5. To corroborate this finding, subsequent experiments involving ketone reduction with NaBH4, reductive amination with benzylamine, and condensation with aryl hydrazine were performed, yielding molecular weights consistent with our conjecture. Additionally, reduction of the nitro group of 9 to the primary amine 10, followed by acylation with acid, furnished the corresponding proposed product 11.",
  "For experimental evaluation we use a subset of internal Bayer doseresponse data and ChEMBL. We convert endpoints values to pIC50 (negative log of the IC50 concentration) and keep only those between 0 and 15. We aggregate repetitive measurements by keeping the maximum value and the corresponding qualifier. If measurements with qualifier < are present, only they are used for aggregation. All considered assays have at least 100 uncensored data points. For validation purposes we cluster compounds into 5 groups. The clusters were obtained by first computing the MACCSkey fingerprint using RDKit, and then utilizing sklearn's KMeans clustering implementation on the MACCSkey fingerprints. Finally, we ensure that every assay contains measurements for compounds in each of 5 clusters. Further statistics about the dataset can be found in Table .",
  "Operando transmission-mode Ni K-edge XAS was conducted using a commercial benchtop spectrometer (easyXAFS300+, from easyXAFS LLC), and all references were measured on the same instrument using an automated sample wheel. Additional XAS measurements of Ni2P nanoparticles were measured ex situ in an air-free cell with the instrument of Gironda, et al. (Figure ). All analyses were performed using Larix inside the Larch program package. The spectrometer energy scales were calibrated to Ni foil at 8333 eV. Ni oxidation was estimated by linear combination fitting to Ni2P, NiO, and Ni3(PO4)2. A change in the exit slit location in the electrocatalysis experiment compared to the reference sample measurement was corrected with a single energy shift across all electrocatalyst results. The energy shift was determined by first floating E0 for the linear combination fit for the average of all scans at 0.8 V vs. RHE. After the energy shift was determined, we stopped floating E0 to minimize degrees of freedom in the linear combination analysis. Linear combination fits were not forced to sum to unity. All sample scans were normalized before linear combination analysis.",

  "Low Li + mobility is observed for PFPE-S15, even lower mobility being seen (on the basis of the 7 Li sideband manifolds) for the salt-in-polymer. The low Li mobility is consistent with long range measurements of Li transport (conduction), which are lower for the PFPE vs PEG systems. Our studies of PEG systems by contrast show gradually increasing motion of the PEG backbone with temperature, rapid Li mobility being seen at higher temperatures. Yet the 20 wt% LiTFSI in PFPE has the lowest activation barrier for Li + motion measured in this work.",
  "In conclusion, we saw no strong evidence of an association between higher UFP exposures and lower late-life cognitive function. Future studies should replicate this work as longer-term UFP exposure models become available. Thoughtful monitoring design can enhance exposure assessment and, while potentially less critical in some settings, can support epidemiologic analyses. Campaigns restricted to weekday business or rush hour designs produced worse exposures and less accurate health inferences. Campaigns might consider prioritizing sampling beyond these times to support robust TRAP exposure assessments and subsequent health analyses.",
  "While the paradigm of calibrating expanding QM-regions in a radial distance-based fashion has been established to provide poor convergence for COMT, there is a surprising dearth of exploring alternatives to distance-based active site models in the literature. Using the workflow employed by RINRUS, we present the reaction thermodynamics and free energies of activation for hundreds of QM-cluster models of COMT. The goal is to identify inter-residue contact features that predictively construct accurate and efficient QM-cluster models of enzymes different than that of COMT. Our cheminformatics perspective will be the first rigorous step towards a translatable and generalized computational enzymology protocol.",
  "Due to its purely electrostatic nature, our potential is restricted to compounds in which atoms carry a formal charge. This encompasses the majority of materials found in heterostructures synthesized colloidally with the notable exception of metal domains, that are relevant for plasmonic and catalytic applications.

  "Our computational workflow began with screening our compounds through an internally built machine learning-based tool powered by ChemProp to assess initial prediction capability. The model was trained on 1000's of Pfizer library compounds using only SMILES strings as input for parameter collection. To our dismay, there was no correlation found between measured and predicted DSC onset values of the avibactam prodrug precursor analogs (Figure ). Considering the lack of representation for this specific compound class of substituted sulfates in the Pfizer library, we decided to alter our approach and develop de novo MLR models. Based on the small training set of prodrug analogs, this analysis would take advantage of the chemical overlap of the prodrug between the compounds and rely on descriptors to capture the various leaving group effects.",
  "To remove the intercalated water between the stacked MXene flakes, the free-standing MXene films were annealed at 200 °C in vacuum. Subsequently, the sample was annealed at 500 °C in the vacuum which is known as the approach of removing the -OH functionalization, typically causing the drop of resistivity. The thickness of the film was estimated from SEM images ~ 5 μm.

This behavior is never totally reversible, while never be defined as exactly irreversible due to their individual reversible nature. A fine balance between the reversibility and the irreversibility can be considered as the superlative hybridization of them to generate what cannot be attained neither in a totally reversible nor in a totally irreversible system, and in essential part the Curtin-Hammett principle is found to function in its extended form.",

Graphene is able of conducting heat and electricity in a very good manner, of course along its plane, and has remarkably properties fundamental for several applications ranging from electronics to biology ). Here we aim to consider how graphene can gain magnetic features, that is how to convert graphene into \"magnetic graphene\", a material suitable for spintronics.",
  "Recently, several machine-learning based scoring functions have engaged more comprehensive descriptors and more advanced neural network architectures to predict experimental binding affinities (e.g., Kd values), thus improving the scoring power. However, these machine learning methods were designed to re-score the docked pose, which could not apply to the scenario without 3D protein-ligand structures. For example, 3D CNN models like Atomic Convolutional Neural Networks (ACNN) and KDEEP 39 treated protein-ligand complex as atom property tensors. Furthermore, distance-aware graph neural networks (GNN) like PotentialNet utilized the more efficient graph representation to encode Euclidean symmetries in structures.",
  "The conformation of VHL protein (PDB ID: 1VCB) and KRAS protein (PDB ID: 7RPZ) 61 are respectively derived from crystal structures identified through X-ray diffraction. We first utilize the PyRosetta docking package to generate sets of initial KRAS-VHL encounter complex structures. The rigid-body docking is performed while restraining the distance between the linker attachment atoms of warhead 1 and the E3 ligand as 20Å, ensuring the formation of interfaces appropriate for subsequent design. Subsequently, we categorize the docking structures into fifty poses based on their root-mean-square deviations, which serve as initial points for MD simulations. We then protonate and solvate the initial poses in cubic boxes with explicit TIP3P water and add counter ions to maintain the neutrality of the system. Next, we employ the OpenMM package to conduct all-atom simulations across Folding@Home 65 , with the in-house parameterized force field for the small molecules (i.e., ligand and warheads) and the AMBER ff14SB force field for the proteins.

  "Electrochemical stimulation experiments were performed using a commercial three-electrodes spectro-electrochemistry (SEC) cell (Specac Omnicell, see ESI). The injection of a hot gelator solution in the SEC allowed easy in situ gelation through cooling at room temperature.

Two reduction strategies have been explored in order to better understand how the working electrode potential (Eapp) influence the material response. The first strategy consists in applying a working potential within 1 +• stability range (see Figure ). Using this strategy (later referred as \"direct reduction strategy\") the reduction of (1 2+ )sn species mainly relies on the (potential) electronic conductivity of (1 2+ )sn supramolecular fibers and on the inter molecular electron exchange :",

  "XB interactions involving both phosphate (PO) and ester (CO) oxygen acceptors were evaluated and assigned from the sampled configurations using a criterion based on a Boltzmannweighted free energy landscape constructed using X• • • A distances and the C-X• • • A angles, selecting the configurations that belong to the XB basin. This criterion provides an accurate description of halogen-bonding in the simulations by removing false positives obtained when using a plain geometrical cutoff. The results show that halobenzene derivatives (apart from the chlorinated ones) interact with model phospholipid membranes via XB interactions targeting both PO-and CO-type acceptors, the latter interactions being electrostatically favored due to the less water-exposed environment and intrinsically hydrophobic character (2.77 < log K OW < 3.54) of the probe molecules, despite PO-type acceptors being stronger XB interaction partners. XB probability is also dependent on the orientational preferences with respect to the bilayer normal, with perfluorination favoring higher membrane insertions when XBs are weaker (brominated derivatives), or lower insertions in the case of stronger iodinated molecules together with the C-I vector oriented towards the water phase and hence more limited access to XB acceptors. Nonetheless, the total XB frequencies typically follow the expected order of relative XB donor strength.",
  "Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). The samples were analyzed using AFM-based imaging after the first addition of active monomers, which were also used for TEM imaging. Measurements were carried out on a HOPG (HOPG-ZYA, 0.4° mosaic spread, Mikromasch) surface, which was cleaved and immersed into the sample solution for 60 sec. Then two successive washing steps were performed for 2 sec with ultrapure water (18.2 MΩ cm, Purelab Chorus 1, Elga LabWater). The surface was dried and stored in a desiccator.

  "Nevertheless, knee points result from physical and/or chemical events such as lithium plating, electrolyte drying out, pore clogging or loss of electrical contact following mechanical deformations that differ from classical aging phenomena such as continuous SEI growth . Indeed, these fatal outcomes often originate from cross talking mechanisms by which the chemistry of one electrode or its working potential is suddenly modified by a chemical or physical event occurring at the other electrode. Dedicated workflows combining a set of testing protocols and analysis are therefore needed to correctly ascribe the primary origin for knee points. While intuitively carried out by researchers under given circumstances, such workflows still await widespread adoption in the field.",

  "Two alternative types of electronic transitions have been identified behind the nonaromatic fluorescence phenomenon: n→ π * and charge transfer. In both cases the absorption and fluorescence occur in the near-UV to visible range. In the present study we show that the CO stretching is the key molecular distortion occurring during the S 1 → S 0 relaxation in both types of excitations, by means of non-adiabatic excited state MD simulations of a series of prototypical peptide systems. Importantly, this is equally valid when the S 1 state character is either n→ π * (2B7-para and -anti case) or charge transfer (L-pyro(amm), L-glu, and B1 -B2 + case), suggesting that a common decay pathway could be ubiquitous among proteins and peptide aggregates.",

  "Theory: choice of basis and method. Quasi-spherical InP QD, In77P77 (diameter ~2 nm), was constructed using the bulk zinc blende crystal structure. The undoped structure conformed to a C3v symmetry before optimization. InP/MOx core/shell structures were built from the InP core by exchanging surface In with M (where M=Zn, Cd, Ga, Al) and P with O to form In31P31/M46O46. Ground-state geometric optimizations were performed, and the structures were considered optimized when both the forces [maximum and root-mean-square (rms) of the force 0.000450 and 0.000300 Hartree/Bohr, respectively] and displacement [maximum and rms displacement 0.00018 and 0.0012 Bohr, respectively] values were below the threshold criteria. Surface dangling bonds were terminated using a pseudohydrogen capping scheme to compensate surface ions: ±1/3 to passivate the pure, non-shelled InP QD resulting in an In77P77H108 structure and ±1/2 to passivate the surface O in the InP/MOx system. These systems are expected to exhibit quantum confinement (Bohr exciton radius is 10 nm for InP). Calculations were conducted using the Gaussian software package 74 using the Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof hybrid functional (PBE0) to compute the Kohn-Sham ground-state electronic structure.

The students are instructed to play with the monthly payment value manually. Typically, less than 10 guesses are needed for a regression convergence with 3 significant figures. The students are then free to change the initial parameters to practice a few random calculations using their \"software\" creation. .",
  "To remove residual strain prior to the calculation of elastic constant tensors, the optimization of atomic coordinates and cell parameters was conducted by pretrained PFP and CHGNet models using the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) method, with a maximum of 2000 iterations and a residual force threshold at 0.02 eV/Å. The optimized crystal structure was assessed by the relative deviation ΔV of the cell volume from the experimental volume.",

The 2D formulation is adopted despite the deviations from planarity of the average bilayer configuration, since for all species the motion along z remains bounded from below and from above, and thus it does not contribute to diffusion.",
  "Cotton showed a lesser reduction (∆E = 11.9), but still exhibited fluorescence after Fenton oxidation. Notably, cotton's purple hue (254°) remained distinct from the spectrum of NRstained MPs (ranging from red to green, 352°-87°), allowing it to be easily differentiated from MPs. Despite some decrease in FI, all studied MPs retained their dominant fluorescent hue, with only a slight apparent decrease in FI.",
  "The first insights into the application of ML-based approaches to REPP were gained. Singleobjective optimization was used, considering only the dependence between MMD and polymerization conditions as an optimization target. However, these insights and the created suite of ML-based models and methods allow us to solve more complex reverse engineering tasks in future, taking multiple objectives, e.g., as minimal reaction time, maximal conversion of monomer and initiator.",
  "for the N 2 RR. Finally, we applied a microkinetic model to show the gain in activity the best catalyst sites can give. We achieve a roughly twofold gain in activity over the best monometallic catalyst, and seem to observe that we are running up against the wall of the scaling relations, even for HEAs.",
  "Currently, iMD-VR only employs implicit solvation; to make the transition between iMD-VR and US more seamless, this was retained during sampling. However, given water molecules are thought to play a key role in benzamidine binding to trypsin, exclusion of solvent is not ideal. We also employed protein backbone restraints here to limit the conformational space accessible to MD trajectories, thus requiring shorter convergence time for both US and path optimization with the ASM. An additional benefit of this is that consistency between runs is improved, since the global protein structure is prevented from diverging. However, as the protein can no longer freely move, some resolution of the unbinding process is lost. Case in point, just before exiting the binding pocket, run 7 appeared to form a favourable interaction with a Tyr39 However, a known metastable state has benzamidine sandwiched between this and Tyr151. As the protein had a limited range of movement, benzamidine could not 'reach' both tyrosine residues during sampling. Backbone restraints also likely artificially increased the free energy differences we observed as the starting, bound complex becomes oversampled, which in turn causes US to overestimate the stability.",

The sample displacement was refined but constrained to scale linearly with temperature. Note that lattice strain was not refined due to the limited available 2θ window and resulting uncertainty in deconvoluting strain and crystallite size.",
  "Whereas Fig. plots adiabatic energies, it is often helpful to interpret a window of quantum states in terms of a diabatic representation. As such, in order to approximate the coupling between diabatic states, following Ref. 45, we extended the generalized Mulliken-Hush formalism with Boys localization. Here we diabatize only the ground state and first excited state, and so the coupling becomes:",
  "To run simulations, we adjusted some settings to not going search too far and save computational resources, because molecules upon growing increase their molecular weight, it was unreasonable to continue generation after reaching the molecular mass of a desired ligand. The threshold values of physicochemical parameters were set to the corresponding values of a larger ligand + 15% (MW, logP, TPSA) and RTB was set to the corresponding value of a larger ligand + 1. To further restrict the generation, we chose RMSD threshold to 1Å and set minimum PLIP similarity 0.6 for 2ZWZ and 3S1G and 0.5 for 2HB1 (Table ). This should guide generations towards compounds preserving the binding pose of a starting fragment and its interactions with a corresponding protein. For generation we chose CHEMBL SA2 fragment library and radius 2. As a selection strategy we used clustering with 100 clusters and selection of top 1 compounds from every cluster. This was done to make search more exhaustive and cover a larger chemical space. This did not increase computational costs substantially, because we started from relatively large fragments and the target molecules should be generated in a few steps. Overall, for each of three targets from 7600 to 23600 molecules were generated.",
  "We first conduct 3 ns long NPT simulations (1 atm, 298 K) with harmonic distance restraints (25 kcal/mol/ Å2 ) between Mg 2+ and its six coordinators. We then reduce these harmonic restraints over the next 1.2 ns of NPT simulations. Then we carry out an additional 300 ps of NPT simulations to determine average box volumes. Next, we select snapshots from the final 300 ps trajectories that have volumes closest to the average volumes and use them to initiate 15 unrestrained NVT runs, one for each binding mode. We carry out NVT simulations for 30 ns.",
  "whose derivation has been detailed in Smoluchowski's original 1917 seminal papers and has been reviewed in many reviews and textbooks (see example literature). This equation using the Fick's gradient and flux assumption thus is suitable for aggregations or crystallizations of probe molecules that form real concentration gradient near the target. This equation is usually used to define if a reaction has diffusion-controlled kinetics. which is significantly smaller than Equation 18 given that r 0 <<L. This difference comes from the different assumption that in the 3D equation, the probe can cross the target without hitting when they approach each other, thus the probability volume after the target shown in Figure red zone is not counted into the collision probability. This difference is rather definitive, not mechanistic because the adsorption rate is a physical value independent of mathematical models. This difference may also come from skipping the fine time details of diffusion and limiting our time resolution to the critical diffusion time of the probes. This blurring introduces uncertainties in the overall adsorption calculations. We believe that adapting different models will affect the estimation of the size of the collision area or volume but will not affect the overall adsorption rate.",
  "There has been some promising work on coupling LCA with IAMs. In these projects the LCI database ecoinvent is transformed, using the IAM data to align the database with the investigated time horizon. This way, the large network of interlinked processes contained in the database can be preserved, only requiring a few additional processes to be modelled which are not yet out on the market. This project started in and and is currently being extended in the software package premise .",
  "The model introduced above provides an explicit construction of a two-dimensional doublewell free energy surface in the space of the coordinates Q A and Q T that describes the spin crossover between the LS and HS states. To give a detailed description of SCO we use transition state theory (TST) 60 to calculate the transition rates and determine the characteristic temperature of the thermal-induced crossover (T 1/2 ), and the highest temperature (T LIESST ) for which the trapped state is stable following light-induced spin-state trapping (LIESST).",
  "The reaction enthalpy can be used as a measure for the effectiveness of the error cancellation, where reaction enthalpies close to zero indicate the highest amount of cancellation. Overall, the small benchmark study shows that the CBH approach provides enthalpies of formation that are well within the experimental uncertainty of ±10 kJ mol -1 for the adsorbates, except for HC(O) * O due to the discussed reasons. The lack of experimental or highly accurate theoretical data of larger adsorbates prevents further benchmark tests of the CBH approach at the time of this publication.",
  "Traditionally XES has been unable to definitively resolve nuclear oscillations, however, recent time-resolved XES measurements of iron carbene show that coherent nuclear motion on long lived excited states initiated by a charge transfer transition can shift the Kα and Kβ emission spectra, manifesting in oscillations in emission line intensities. We will show that the oscillations we observe in our XES spectra occur on the ground electronic state following the BET and can be used to observe low frequency nuclear motion.",

  "Phosphane-ene polymer network synthesis was effectively adapted from a solution-based method to gas phase MLD. In the proposed mechanism of film growth, the plasma-enhanced MLD process leveraged phosphinyl radical chemistry to add these species to C=C groups on a siloxane crosslinking agent (D4 Vinyl ) with GPCs of 0.6 -2.0 Å and film thicknesses of 20 -120 nm. XPS analysis highlighted bonding arrangements of P(III) and P(V) sites, demonstrating uptake of oxygen during incidental atmospheric exposure. To assess the O2 scavenging ability of the film, a sputtered XPS depth profile was collected. A shift from P V to P III with increasing depth was observed, which indicated surface reactivity that slows diffusion of dioxygen through the film.",
  "We calculated the Pt/C anode catalyst cost assuming an equivalent production Pt/C process, but with 0.025 mgPt cm -2 loading (cost divided by five). We based the costs of the other PEMFC components in the Pt/C system at 1,000 stacks year -1 on previous values from James et al. for their 2020 scenario. For comparison, we also conducted a separate learning curve calculation based on the cost of a PtCo/C cathode catalyst from James et al. (Table ).",
  "Between the nanomaterials and organic chemicals product datasets, most features had relatively comparable data (see Appendix C). The chemical properties for the respective datasets, however, formed two very distinct clusters (Figure ). We felt this juxtaposition would constitute selection of the data-poor framework for predicting nanomaterial product WFs instead of attempting to apply models trained on organic chemicals product data. The differences in chemical property data also shaped the optional data augmentation strategy described in Appendix D.",
  "In this work, we extend our capabilities to molecular beam scattering from aqueous solutions and present the first angle-resolved scattering measurements of Ne from a flat jet of cold salty water. Highly superspecular scattering behavior dominates at each scattering geometry that is attributed to anisotropic momentum transfer to the surface. The TD channel exhibits a characteristic cosθ angular distribution and the TD fractions are similar to those reported for dodecane. Fitting the fractional energy loss in the IS channel to a soft-sphere kinematic model as a function of deflection angle shows that energy transfer to internal modes of the salty water surface is larger compared to the internal excitation of dodecane at similar beam energies.",
  "Namely, the reference space is tailored to the states under consideration and is kept optimally small. This, in combination with the energy-based configuration selection criterion, limits the growth of the FOIS CSF basis with increasing numbers of states. This makes the DFT/MRCI approach particularly well suited to the calculation X-ray spectra, for which dense manifolds of core-excited states spanning many eV typically have to be considered.",
  "Mode N has no H-bond interaction between the hinge and the ligand. To date there are no FDAapproved ATP-competing inhibitors with mode N. Finally, in addition to having the hydrogenbonding pattern as mode G, mode O has an additional aromatic stacking interaction (face-to-face), which comes from the aromatic ring of the GK+2 side chain.",
  "In order to relate the changes in configuration to chemical bonding, we extended the study to a PDOS analysis of implicitly solvated optimized structures and a sampling of the configurations obtained from the AIMD simulations. Our results showed that the observed trends of axial and equatorial coordination and hydroxyl and an alkyl coordination in the gas-phase PDOS were preserved in the sampled liquid trends and suggest that these trends would be experimentally verifiable.",
  "The extensive presence of mesopores and macropores acts as electrolyte reservoirs and shortens the ion diffusion distance -as highlighted in previous sections. Therefore, the excellent electrochemical performance of CoSe2@C/MX-B for lithium/sodium storage can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the CoSe2 nanoparticles, the multi-heteroatom-doped carbon matrix and MXenes sheets, as well as the unique architecture observed.",
  "These data suggest that the reaction follows the classical mechanism, similar to the one proposed for the wellstudied C-H insertion reactions (Scheme 3, c). Initially, amide reacts with PhIO to form the imino-iodane. We assume this to be the rate-determining step, based on the low kinetic isotopic effect and the fact that the reaction proceeds almost immediately if the preformed PhI=NTs nitrene precursor was employed. Next, the imino-iodane forms dirhodium singlet nitrene species, which then reacts with nucleophilic borane in a concerted fashion.",
  "The combined mechanisms of crossover of both oxidized and reduced states and degradation of the reduced state, when P ox = P red ̸ = 0, are not sufficient to explain the observed experimental trend of increasing symmetric cell capacity fade with increasing crossover flux, as we shall see. When both CLS and NCLS have the same time-averaged SOC of 50% throughout cycling, both sides have the same net loss of AQDS through the SOC-dependent first-order chemical degradation reaction, and any AQDS crossover will be balanced by equal flux in the opposite direction, even if the magnitude of that flux is greater for a more permeable membrane.",
  "In the case of 2D MoS 2 , conversion and bulk ion intercalation, classical battery processes hold only during the first two cycles, and, subsequently, evolve into capacitive processes. In the case of MXenes, including Ti 3 C 2 T x , and investigation in set ups, in principle, targeting LIB anode applications, charge storage mechanisms depart radically from classical Faradaic battery processes. A variety of identifiers have been proposed to describe the underlying energy storage mechanisms including: \"intercalation pseudocapacitance\", \"intercalation with partial redox\" and \"carbide supercapacitor processes\".

  "The set-up for electrochemical measurements, along to the electrochemical reaction cell, includes two peristaltic pumps (PP1300, WVR), an ultrapure water (Milli-Q) reservoir with temperature controller (Pilot ONE HUBER circulation thermostat), and a computer-controlled potentiostat (SP-300 Bio-Logic with a ± 10 A/[0, 5] V booster). For a series of specific measurements, two separate water circuits were installed, one to pump water into the internal heat exchanger of the cathodic plate and the other directly to the anodic flow side. Before starting operation and measuring, water was pumped for 30 min into the IPEC cell at a flow rate of 5 mLmin -1 . A REGLO-CPF Digital reciprocated pump with piston pump-head RH0CKC was used to deliver 17 mLmin -1 for an IPEC module.

  "We next wanted to test if the reduction in duplex stability from the NV-modification on the ASOs could be used to control RNAse H activity using light. RNase H has a shallow, positively charged groove, which fits the charged PO/PS backbone of the DNA in a RNA/DNA hybrid duplex . Therefore, we hypothesised that if any of the NV-modified ASOs did bind the mRNA, by alkylating the PS-linkage, we would prevent RNAse H from recognising its substrate as we removed the charge and increased the steric bulk of the site.",

  "Recently, Jorner et al. reported predicting experimental activation energies (ΔGexp) for SNAr reactions using physical chemical descriptors from both ground states and transition states including DFT activation energy, ΔGdft. They achieved a top-1 accuracy of 86% on patent reaction data for regio-and chemoselectivity prediction. While this was a highly effective strategy, we envisioned that the activation energy difference between reacting sites (ΔΔG ‡ ) alone may provide robust predictions for regioselectivity applications, given that the error cancels out in DFT computations; this was also demonstrated in a number of computational studies for SNAr reactions. Therefore, DFT activation energy differences carry more decisive information and may be used directly as a stand-alone reference model or base values for delta learning instead of serving only to provide conventional DFT descriptors for machine learning models.",

Both lower-valent phosphorus fine chemicals and pentavalent phosphorus commodity chemicalsfrom the ubiquitous herbicide glyphosate to the food-grade phosphoric acid in a can of sodaare produced via the intermediacy of P in elemental white phosphorus, P4. This roundabout reduction-reoxidation sequence is employed in part to overcome the incredible stability of the phosphate P-O bond (595 kJ/mol), which resists facile substitution or elimination chemistries that would enable the direct conversion of raw phosphate to valuable phosphites or phosphonates. Despite emerging alternative processes, the phosphorus chemical value chain relies upon the \"thermal process\" (Figure top; Equation ), which employs extremely forcing conditions to drive the reduction of phosphate to P4 by carbon coke.",
  "Further examination of the application of this Ag-catalyzed HIE was commenced in gram-scale experiments. As expected, the reaction rendered a quantitate labelled product recovery after distillation, with a slightly elevated deuterium incorporation (Figure ). We also found the rate of meta-deuteration could be suppressed by introducing acid salts, for instance, PCy3•HBF4 rendered the highest ortho-selectivity of 94:5 (Figure ). Subsequently, chemical transformation of deuterated nitroaromatics was conducted to show its potential as a deutero-building block for further functionalization. As expected, cross-coupling reaction with nitrobenzenes, including C-O, C-S, and C-C bond couplings, didn't affect the deuterium distribution (Figure ), all the transformation left the labelled sites unreacted.

  "The predicted atomic energies contain information about atoms in the direct local neighborhood and beyond via mean field updates, which is why we refer to the energy prediction as semi-local.

At the same time, both contributions are based on analytically derived, physical equations such that they follow the correct asymptotic (at this moment pairwise) decay. This is an inevitable requirement for the scalability (EAST) to length-scales exceeding the ones covered by the training data.",
  "To enable comparison between rigorous isotherms for different materials and probe molecules, a unified analysis that might allow global comparison with polar and non-polar molecules would be highly valued. In the review of Aumond et al. , there are 6 key rigorous isotherm models presented including the mechanistically based Henry, Langmuir, BET as well as the thermodynamically based Derjaguin, Frenkel-Halsey-Hill (FHH) and Polanyi potential models.",
  "In the third step, suspect screening by accurate mass match (with mass tolerance) can be performed. We used the PFAS NIST suspect list as a template, with extension of other inhouse identified PFAS. For suspect screening, three adducts can be chosen which are [M-H] - for negative polarity, and both [M+H] + and [M] + for positive polarity (compounds such as betaines present in various AFFF formulations are often detected as M + ions) .",

  "Recently, some of the above approaches have been compared and found that a urea-and SDS-containing lysis buffer coupled to ultrasonication yielded higher protein recovery than bead beating in microbiome samples, with minimal sample loss, though both methods achieved similar peptide and protein identifications (X. . Careful selection of lysis buffers is also critical to avoid interference with downstream MS analysis. For example, ion suppression-inducing detergents like Tween-20 should be avoided unless they are removed during cleanup, as in methods like suspension trapping (S-trap) or FASP.",
  "In comparison to the ablated CGNN baseline (mean test MAE of 0.68), the improvement relative to the DTI baseline is slightly at that the specific choice of architecture and parameterization also matters. Using docked poses of higher estimated quality (RMSD), the observed improvement, both in terms of correlation and MAE, is much stronger. These observations support the main hypothesis that in silico structural information can be useful for training structure-based machine learning methods, and more so if it is of high quality.",
  "Bacterial growth was reduced upon arabinose-induced peptide expression under both growth conditions, with and without heme. This suggests that the HasR TonB box peptide bound to the inner membrane TonB protein, subsequently interfered with TonB-dependent hemin internalization as well as probably with the pyoverdine and/or pyochelin-dependent iron uptake pathways used by the PAO1 strain when grown in the absence of hemin. Thus, less efficient iron sequestration resulted in a growth reduction. A similar study with overexpressing the Nterminal domain of FpvA (regulating and TonB box domains) showed an inhibition of 55 Fe uptake by pyoverdine (PYO). 34 The transformed bacteria were grown in CAA medium in the presence or not of 0.25 µM hemin and with or without arabinose (ARA, 1%) induction to induce the peptide expression. Bacterial growth is followed by monitoring optical density at 600 nm (OD600 nm). Errors bars were calculated from three independent biological replicates.",
  "Transformers, neural networks that used attention and were originally designed to improve language modeling in ML, , have also been demonstrated to be a powerful architecture for neural wavefunctions. The Psiformer architecture by Glehn et al. makes use of a multi-headed self-attention over the coordinates of electrons . Using this ansatz, the authors achieved lower ground state energies than previously published methods. In particular, the Psiformer achieved ground state energy of benzene that was lower than conventional VQMC and even DMC. Given enough computing budget, the Psiformer architecture tends to give the lowest energies so far.",
  "where Z i = Z(M i ). Note that the ratio (20) can be adjusted by the prior likelihood for the models themselves, if these differ; 13 here we assume there is no difference, so (20) is valid as written.

  "Figure depicts the endpoint (i.e., after the completion) I-V response of RCA reaction products (primer concentration 20 nM, MB concentration 100 M, LRCA reaction) averaged over replicates. Both the experiments (RCA as well as electrochemical measurement) have been performed at ambient temperature. Therefore, the electrochemical RCA, if successful and sensitive enough, would be highly utilitarian in detecting DENV and its serotypes in limitedresource settings. Our EBSD test results for electrochemical end-point RCA have been in agreement with the aforementioned explanation, where the peak current magnitude for NTC samples was 3 times higher than that of TC samples with a change in peak current ( ) of 6.31",
  "As a first approach, peripheral alkyl substitution of four of the six available sites was proposed to (i) enhance solubility, and (ii) favor eclipsing π-surfaces. The addition of hydrogen bonding motifs was deliberately avoided because of their superior capability to order systems . As reference systems, we included the unfunctionalized porphyrinoid to investigate the effect of a core without sidechains and the macrocycle bearing tert-butyl groups due to its reduced propensity to self-assemble .",
  "We prepared a modular organic system for in-depth studies on how subtle structural differences can affect magnetic relaxation properties in transition metal coordination compounds. Tunable capability of synthesized complexes comes from: (i) novel pentadentate L red-R N,O-aminal ligand formed by unexpected in situ reduction of the parent Schiff base ligand L; (ii) the chosen solvent/reagent alcohol; (iii) coordination Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins preferences of metal salt and its counterion. Considering that the SIM-active d 9 coordination compounds are rarely encountered, two structurally similar octahedral Cu(II) compounds were prepared as the case study. Both analogues were revealed to be rare examples of magnetically isolated copper system that display slow relaxation of magnetisation, with phenomenon being more pronounced for the perchlorate analogue 1 than the triflate 2. Extensive series of experimental techniques and theoretical approaches allowed us to understand the effect of geometrical and structural changes on copper(II) electronic states and consequently observed magnetic behaviour. It is predominantly the result of: (i) the octahedral structural distortions exerted by the alkoxy groups appended on the L red-1/2 scaffold; (ii) spatial arrangements of the Cu(II)---Cu(II) pairs in the unit cell due to the pyridine/oxazoline crystal packing contacts. This translates to the character of the hyperfine structure observed in the EPR spectra as a function of temperature and applied frequencies, related to the interactions of S = ½ electron spin of Cu(II) ion with the nuclear spin I = 3 /2. In 1, the more square planar character within the N3O ligand-solvent plane and slow magnetic relaxation phenomenon is more pronounced than in 2, despite the inherently detrimental effect of the nitrogen atoms. Relaxation of magnetization proceeds through the combination of Raman, direct and QTM processes.",
  "For the TDDFT calculations of the FeRu complex, clusters were extracted from the equilibrated QM/MM trajectory. Clusters (≈ 238 atoms) were constructed by centering the transition metal complex center as well as a 4Å thick shell of explicit water molecules surrounding the complex. These clusters are sufficiently large to capture the ground state properties compared with experiment as seen in Figs. , and S4 of the Supplementary Information. Excited state geometries were computed by optimizing these clusters on the MMCT surface and Fe K-edge XANES calculations were performed on these excited-state geometries to obtain transient spectra. The MMCT excited state optimizations were performed with TDDFT gradients, while the XANES calculations were performed with the restricted excitation window TDDFT approach, 66 including higher-order contributions to the oscillator strengths to capture the quadrupolar nature of the pre-edge transitions at the Fe K-edge. To follow the electron transfer, Mulliken and Löwdin populations were calculated on the Fe and Ru atoms to track the hole charges as the system evolved along the MMCT surface.",
  "Protein conformations from final minima were inspected for the interaction between residues determining the active/inactive conformation of the enzyme. Work from Klinman et al. identified residues (Trp49 and Phe272) within a thermophilic ADH (htADH) from B. stearothermophiles to be involved in a p-stacking interaction that has direct effect on the active site microenvironment. These residues are not directly located at the proteins' active site but on the surface, connecting homo-monomers.",
  "This NTA analysis of urine and serum samples used full scan and MS/MS spectra match from pooled samples by ddMS 2 scan. Batch effects were significant but could be corrected by the Combat package (Figure ). This is consistent with previous study that found differences in characteristics of LC/MS metabolomics data before batch correction. The raw dataset showed many features in blanks and field controls. Chemical features in QC samples showing peak areas that were five times higher than those of the blanks. ESI + and ESI -revealed the most ions eluted from 10 to 20 min during chromatography (Figure ). ESI + covered a higher range of charge-to-mass ratios at the beginning and end of the run. Only 344 features (~0.05% of the merged features) were matched across ESI + and ESI -datasets, highlighting varied chemical properties in current samples.",
  "During the NAMD simulations, we solved the equations of motion using the Störmer-Verlet method, a reliable numerical integration scheme widely used in molecular dynamics simulations. The time-dependent Baeck-An couplings, denoted as σ i j , were derived from the second time-derivatives of the energy gaps ∆E i j , thus avoiding the sophisticated calculations in the non-adiabatic coupling. 41",
  "Exchange of mim - for the smaller and weaker coordinating im - linker facilitates metallinker bond breaking, while the parallel exchange for the larger bim - linker stabilizes the liquid phase and prevents the crystallization of a dense ZIF. Using a systematic approach, we were able to screen the compositional phase space to create a ternary phase diagram visualizing the regions of congruent melting, incongruent melting, or no melting. Remarkably, some of the linker-exchanged ZIF-8 derivatives exhibit ultrahigh glass-forming ability (Tg /Tm = 0.95) as well as outstanding porosity (up to 25%).",
  "(1) If S1 states can be excited further to Sn states during a PA pulse, these typically vibrationally relax rapidly back to S1. The fast S1→Sn→S1 cycles of such \"RSA\" chromophores (reverse-saturable absorbers) can thus allow higher PA signal than ordinary chromophores which use S0→S1→S0 cycles (\"SA\", saturable absorbers). RSAs have been widely reported in PA studies in vitro. However, further excitation depends non-linearly on (high) laser fluence; and within biologically-allowed energy limits, RSAs are outperformed by ordinary PA emitters that simply absorb light more strongly. We also argue that cycling RSAs between S1/Sn states may cause photoreactive damage to the chromophore or to biological tissues.",

  "Overall, the results from the local geometric feature analysis on short-and longrange scales suggest that the coordination states of elements A and B are crucial for accurately predicting chemisorption strength. Specifically, the first-nearest neighbor interactions between the adsorbate central atom and the host element A, as captured by neighbor A n, together with the neighbor information of ligand B on a longerrange scale (neighbor B 4 ), are identified as the most effective descriptors compared to others defined by various cutoff radii.",
  "The identification of a binding pocket for free fatty acids in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein led us to explore the possibility of this site as a target for binding of approved drugs (Figure ). Accordingly, we used the Bristol University Docking Engine (BUDE ) to screen in silico a library of existing approved drugs that are potential candidates for repurposing against COVID-19. As the starting structure for docking, we chose an equilibrated frame from MD simulations of the spike trimer in the locked, LA-bound form described above (hereafter cryo-EMeq), because this structure had side chains optimally oriented to form salt-bridges and hydrogen bonds with the linoleate head group (LA -is treated throughout as linoleate, as above). BUDE results were filtered on the basis of ligand size, such that compounds having < 15 or > 45 heavy atoms were eliminated. The remaining compounds were then ranked based on their predicted binding affinity (BUDE energy) and the single best conformer for compounds scoring ≤ -100 kJ/mol was selected for more detailed analysis. The list of compounds ranked in this way is given in Supplementary Information (Table ).",
  "Nevertheless, these effects result in only modest shifts in adsorption energy-typically up to 100 meV-making them significant primarily in specific applications such as room-temperature gas detection . While such modulation alone may not lead to substantial differences in the catalytic performance of TMD surfaces, the unique characteristics of the X-Mo bonding provide a chemical basis that can be exploited in the functionalization of these monolayers, especially considering that catalysis on these surfaces is usually enhanced through defect engineering.",
  "The MA 0.875 EA 0.125 PbI 3 mixed cation perovskite was simulated using DFT in the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation (VASP) code. A 2 × 2 × 2 supercell in the settings of the parent cubic perovskite MAPbI 3 was generated from the orthorhombic structure of MAPbI 3 , and all coordinates and cell parameters were relaxed. One of the eight MA cations was substituted with EA and fully relaxed. Several initial EA orientations within the same framework of MA orientations were tried, and the lowest energy one was selected for further modelling.",
  "We used two different types of restraints depending on the system; either (a) ligand poses were restrained to one another or, (b) ligand poses were restrained to the protein. For the :irst type of restraints the pairs of atoms were chosen via visual inspection and their contribution to the :inal free energy cancels out between the poses. The second type of restraint requires careful consideration since it has the potential to introduce numerical instabilities or convergence issues in the system. We chose the multiple distance restraining scheme introduced by Clark et al as it is easily implemented, computationally ef:icient and devoid of convergence or sampling issues.",
  "Moreover, the analysis of Deroche et al. suggests that adsorption in microporous structures of zeolites can be effectively modeled with spherical geometry despite more complex pore morphology observed in these materials. Extreme conditions of confinement are believed to modify the interactions in all directions allowing resident molecules to be considered as confined angstrofluids with spherical topology. Similar arguments could be applied to MOF structures in which case the coefficient of the nanocapillary term of Equation ( ) would increase from 2 to 3.",
  "Comparing the spectra obtained at the three different conditions in Figure , the spectrum measured at 200 mV, low O2 condition has a much lower overall absorption at 1.6 K similar as observed at RT.

  "Finally, to demonstrate scalability of p-HQ formation, as well as the applicability of our methodology in natural product synthesis, we pursued the total synthesis of the neuroprotective agent (±)-indanostatin 3b (Figure ). The marked base sensitivity of our envisioned dienophile, 1,3cyclopentenedione (49), has precluded its application as a coupling partner in conceptually related anionic (formal) DA strategies towards p-HQs. Pleasingly, methylfuran 48 (synthesized in one step from methylsuccinic anhydride) reacted smoothly with 49 in MeOH at room temperature, providing gram-scale quantities of p-HQ 50 in 93% yield, and without the need for chromatographic purification. A subsequent onepot oxidation/alkylation procedure (via the intermediate trione hydrate) yielded over one gram of (±)-indanostatin in only three steps total (cf. 9 steps for the previous total synthesis 30 ).",
  "Strategies must ensure and maintain inert atmosphere conditions to adapt SDL systems for such highly reactive transformations. Currently, these range from more basic methods, such as global system purging or applying an inert gas blanket, to advanced approaches, like adapting traditional laboratory apparatus for automation and installing robotic systems within inert glovebox environments . For instance, Bell et al. recently developed the \"Schlenkputer\", an autonomous synthesizer that uses a combination of motors, switches and valves, and XDL commands to manage tap positions on a Schlenk line and control vacuum levels. Paired with a liquid handling system, they successfully synthesized highly air-sensitive Ce(N(SiMe 3 ) 2 ) 3 , highly moisture-sensitive Lewis acid tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane, and MgI dimer via Na 0 reduction 204 . Advances like the Schlenkputer highlight the potential of SDLs to tackle air-and moisture-sensitive chemistries while emphasizing the importance of designing systems that prioritize safety. Nonetheless, automation for these chemistries is still in the nascent stage, and ongoing research should also advance with safety in mind.",

The same observation can be made for DIU, banned since 2008 in agricultural treatments, which is now used only as a biocide for fouling treatment on house materials, and was observed all through the year at site n°5156950. The site n°5080960 also exhibits some trace levels of residues that were less, or even not quantified on site n°5156950, such as SMZ and NFZ. Such herbicides were characteristic of vineyard treatments in the early 2000s in France, and probably correspond here to remnant background contaminations.

  "While the reactions considered in this work take place in inert-gas matrices, the description of synthetic chemistry would have to include solvent effects. Although instanton theory cannot simulate liquids explicitly, solvent effects can be approximately accounted for by means of polarizable continuum models, 122,123 methods based on the spectral density of the bath or by building small clusters that represent the first solvent shells. In this way, instanton theory could be used to search for tunnelling effects in chemical reactions under standard wet-lab conditions.",
  "Moreover, we recall 11 that Martini 2 ring-like models deviate from the overall force field trend and lead to systematically higher heat of vaporizations.

The potentials for titanium (Ti), oxygen (O) and tantalum (Ta) explicitly account for 4 (d 2 s 2 ), 6 (s 2 p 4 ) and 11(p 6 s 2 d 3 ) valence electrons, respectively. The calculations were executed using an energy cutoff for the plane wave basis set at 420 eV and the convergence criteria for electronic relaxations at 10 -4 eV and for ionic relaxations at 0.02 eV/Å. The computed bulk lattice parameters are a = b=3.861 Å and c = 9.781 Å for the anatase phase (I41/amd) and we used supercells containing 2 x 2 x 2 unit cells (32 atoms). Ti1-xTaxO2 was modelled by replacing Ti ions with one, two, three and four Ta ions; these correspond to a 0.03, 0.06, 0.09 and 0.12 mol fraction (x) doping. The TiO2 supercell is relaxed at each Ta content and no symmetry is imposed.

For each new set of parameters during the optimisation, energy evaluation was performed after quenching each decoy in order to reach a local minimum and have a structure effectively competing with the native. The genetic algorithm ran with 80 genes and with up to 100 generations, though often convergence was reached before.",
  "Computed double-layer capacitance profiles for Au(210) in a NaF electrolyte show that the mPB models with a linear dielectric are incapable of capturing the shape of experimentally determined double layer capacitance curve even when several factors accounting for ion-specific effects are accounted for. All the utilized mPB models including linearized, point-like Gouy-Chapmann, finite-ion Bikerman-Freise and the ion decrement model yield almost constant double layer capacitances rather than an experimentally obtained bell-shaped capacitance within the tested potential range in a 0.5 M NaF solution. Furthermore, the absolute capacitance values are very sensitive to the details on the underlying solvent cavity.",

  "Notably, molecules generated by vanilla diffusion processes bear non-negligible internal strains, indicating the existence of physically unstable structures. On the other hand, as expected, lower temperature in BGM kernel results in a more localized Boltzmann distribution and forces with overall smaller magnitudes.

  "Numerous studies on IL/charged solid interfaces, employing XRR, In the former case, the discrepancy may stem from disruption of the solvation structure due to an unstable substrate.

Conversely, the RbI(100) and NaCl(100) surfaces were stable during observation, and we did not obtain substrate dissolution-induced layers. This , some profiles without shoulder-like innermost peak, were also found occasionally (Figure ). We converted the Δf profiles (Figures ) into corresponding short-range force profiles, and peak separations and intensities of solvation force peaks were summarized in Table and Figure , respectively.

The rarity of proton transfer from the surface sites to the water molecules belonging to the liquid phase during equilibration is rationalized by this high predicted pKa value.",

Parametric analysis of this 1D model indicates that the aluminum metal ion dissolution rate is a diffusion-controlled process at ambient atmospheric conditions.

Our MD simulations provide direct numerical inputs for more sophisticated continuum-based corrosion models and indicate that RH effects on ion transport rates are an essential physical feature to capture when modeling these processes at higher length scales.",

  "To evaluate effective band offset, we analyze a thin cBN layer inserted into the bulk pristine diamond. Accordingly, a long-range asymmetric electrostatic potential due to dipoles will be introduced into diamond, and the band edge of diamond regions at two sides of the dipoles can be shifted oppositely, leading to a band offset with the same magnitude as the electrostatic potential difference. Due to the presence of a polarized interface, modulation doping is expected to be achievable in diamond bulk, which employs the band offset in heterojunctions and can generate high carrier density without introducing the actual dopant atoms in the electrical transport region.",

We attribute these trends to an increased electronic interaction between the donors and the acceptor in 2CzPN and t BuDPA-2CzPN owing to the less twisted conformation present in these two compounds. Increased electron density on the electron-accepting unit destabilizes the LUMO with respect to the more twisted conformers.

  "We define two classes of sites where foreign ions can incorporate that contribute differently to the OER activity and electrochemical response. First, there are interior \"bulk\" sites where the cation is substituting either Ni or Co cations. These modify the electronic energies of the redox-active host metal atoms (Ni or Co) and thus influence the peak position of the Ni or Co redox waves during voltammetry . Second, surface sites where the cations are adsorbed onto, rather than substituted into, the host NiOxHy and CoOxHy porous structures (Supplementary Figure ) where the coordination by water and terminal hydroxyls makes them likely OER active sites Pt/Ti/glass substrates. Pt was used because it is OER inactive and has limited electronic interaction with any in-situ formed FeOxHy when Fe species are present in the electrolyte .",

And we are clearly aware that the threshold difference could be large for different haloarenes in the coordination of the accessible surface of Pd(0) atom (with a suitable positive potential VSPd(max)) with the \"side-on\" surface of the halogen (with the negative potential VSX(min)), due to the polarization capability difference. For iodoarenes and bromoarenes, there is evidence 111 that visualization of the polarization could occur in distances greater than 1.2 times than Van der Waals radii. And this might partially explain the observed higher reactivity of iodo/bromoarenes in Pd(0) OA following a 3-centered concerted mechanism .",

  "Based on absorption measurements we report the size dependence of the bandgap, second optical transition, absorption coefficient, oscillator strength and associated radiative lifetime of the 1S absorption transition. Time resolved PL measurements yield PL lifetimes significantly longer than that expected from the absorption strength, showing that PL involves a different fine-structure level than the absorption. Single particle PL measurements reveal narrow single particle linewidths of 60-80 meV at room temperature. Transient absorption measurement allow to determine the size dependent biexciton lifetime, which follows previously reported volume scaling trends for other QD materials. Overall, the observed trends of the absorption coefficient, oscillator strength and biexcton lifetime agree quite well with those obtained on other QD materials, after taking into account the bulk optical properties of InP and the generally smaller size of visible emitting InP CQDs when compared to CdSe CQDs.",

  "The structural distortions underlying the polymorphism in Bi 2 Sn 2 O 7 are driven by the stereochemically-active Bi 6s lone pair. Interaction of the Bi 6s and O 2p states produces filled antibonding orbitals at the top of the valence band, which facilitate coupling to the metal 6p states. This hybridisation is symmetry forbidden in the cubic γ phase, but instantaneous symmetry breaking from vibrations allows the Bi 6p and Bi 6s/O 2p states to couple. This stabilises the filled antibonding orbital and offsets the increase in energy from the structural distortion, thereby favouring lower-symmetry structures. This model is supported from the symmetrymode analysis of the diffraction data by the larger amplitudes of distortion modes associated with Bi 4 O ′ tetrahedra compared to those of SnO 6 octahedra. This is also consistent with the eigenvectors of the imaginary modes involved in the γ → α new transition path (Figure ), which show coupled rotations of the Bi and O ′ atoms with very little movement of Sn.",

  "We measure single-shot BB-2PA spectra using an amplified Yb:KGW laser (Light Conversion, Carbide) operating at 1 kHz. The laser fundamental at 1030 nm was used as the pump beam, with a synchronized chopper wheel blocking alternating pump pulses for shot-to-shot background subtraction. A small portion of the laser output was used to obtain broadband probe pulses via super-continuum generation in a YAG crystal. The two beams propagate in opposite directions through a 5 mm cuvette containing the sample solution, where they cross at a small angle (< 5 • ). After the sample, the probe beam passes into a 1/8 m imaging spectrograph (Newport, MS127i) with a 300 line/mm grating that disperses the light onto a 256 pixel photodiode array (Hamamatsu, S3901-256Q).

  "Given the dependence of the absolute potential on the used vdW radius, we report the electrostatic po-tential profiles in Fig. with respect to the PZC of a given model. First, the electrostatic potential obtained from the boundary conditions method decreases to zero slower compared to the other methods and the gradient is nonzero, as expected. Similar behaviour was observed also with the similar ESM 16 method. Of the used mPB models, linearized PB, GC, and Bikerman-Fraise produce almost identical and overlapping potential curves. When the Stern layer is added (shown for Bikerman-Fraise), screening is delayed but is otherwise similar to the underlaying mPB.

  "After performing the reaction in a solid-liquid slurry, the solid catalyst can be filtered out easily, except possibly when unsupported nm-sized metal particles are used which would require very fine filters and high pressures. The filtered liquid can then be collected and used in an experiment. An alternative scheme involves a continuous stream of reacting fluid constantly supplied to the reactor and collected downstream. Continuous production of hyperpolarized allyl and propyl acetates in methanol-d4 was recently achieved 756 by HET-PHIP using a setup combining membrane dissolution of p-H2 and a packed-bed reactor with Rh/TiO2 catalyst for flow-through hydrogenation of propargyl acetate (Figure ). The continuous hydrogenation approach is particularly easy to implement for producing continuous streams of hyperpolarized gases which can then be directed to an object under study residing in the NMR/MRI detection region. Transfer of the polarized gas to an NMR instrument should be fast to avoid significant polarization losses caused by relaxation.",

To ensure the correct asymptotic behavior of the XC potential, 100% exact exchange and thus 0% semilocal exchange has been used in the long range in all rangeseparated hybrid variants. Furthermore, the LH, RSLH and LRSLH models were constructed without considering a CF.

Also, range-separated exchange energy densities might require the adaption of the CF models, since the currently available pig CFs are derived from full-range semi-local exchange.",

  "We interpret the instantaneous product formation from S1 within 750 fs in the absence of further spectroscopic signatures of other intermediates, neither at ultrashort nor long timescales), such, that the vibrationally cooled S1 state of the deprotonated pHP species is electronically (and structurally) closely related to the product-forming state T1* of the neutral case. In short, the absence of a triplet state for deprotonated pHP shortcuts the reaction mechanism for pHP at basic pH, thereby giving direct access to a product-forming structure within less than 1 ps. This reflects common strategies used in photochemistry, aiming to stabilize short-lived singlet states to increase reaction rates. The presented transient absorption spectra don't yield direct information on the nature of the transient structure and further, structure sensitive, experiments are necessary to full unravel the reaction intermediates of this extremely fast photo-uncaging reaction. Generally, the results demonstrate the urgent necessity to study reaction dynamics of photolabile protection groups or photocaged compounds applied in biophysical studies under aqueous conditions and at relevant pH as those can be altered in a non-predictable way.",

  "Although some reactions resulting in a solid matrix seem to be simple, a delicate balance between thermodynamics and kinetics regulates the process outcomes and the structure of products. Even though favored thermodynamics hints at the theoretical feasibility and spontaneity of an overall reaction , kinetic constraints may impede the desired organization of TFs on substrates with a reliable yield accuracy. One of the interesting ways to address rational reactant consumption while preserving possible structural and compositional tailoring can be approached by changing cationic sites at the minimized rearrangement of anion frameworks. Cation exchange has proven reliable in converting or doping semiconductor nanocrystals, endowing them with dopant-dependent optoelectronic characteristics and high photostability . Modifying the cation sublattice with functional impurities on extended levels may create unattainable structures under direct synthesis and promote the programmable functionalization of nanomaterials . To make it happen, both heterogeneous ion replacements at the solid-liquid interface and bulk ion diffusion need significant acceleration to achieve a notable phase transition at moderate temperatures . To date, surmounting kinetic limitations in multievent reactions remains a nontrivial task facing specialists in various fields. Moreover, addressing challenges derived from hindered kinetics is important for understanding mechanistic pathways of solid-state ion exchange in non-equilibrium conditions . Recently, defect-associated protocols have appeared powerful enough to improve the performance of a wide range of processes in semiconductor nanocrystals . Selective generation of cationic vacancies has contributed to overcoming energy barriers in aliovalent doping reactions . To implement something similar beyond the nanoscale, it is necessary to create synthetic strategies that include much more complex disturbances in the defect structure of host matrices and might include external auxiliary tools to manage the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of ion exchange processing.",

  "Equation 1 is also written in Kröger Vink notation as Li × Li + H 2 O → H × Li + LiOH . These surface reactions cause myriad detrimental effects at the Li|LLZO interface. First, the presence of lithiophobic species such as Li 2 CO 3 induces poor interfacial contact. Contact loss then leads to current constriction and large overpotentials during cell cycling that exacerbate Li intrusion in the SE and subsequent failure via short circuiting . Second, Li + loss as a result of proton exchange has been reported to diminish the conductivity of LLZO and introduce a resistive, proton-rich interlayer . As constriction is directly tied to bulk properties of the electrolyte, a decrease in LLZO ionic conductivity increases both bulk and constriction impedance in the system 29 .",

To keep the fluid acting under gravity, the fluid shader is constrained within a mesh, for the beaker this was a cylinder that fitted inside the beaker mesh, for the round bottom flask we found that a icospherical mesh (size 3) created in Blender and scaled to fit the flask looks much better. Inertia was roughly modelled as a 'wobble' function. There is no pouring animation or effect, the fluid level in glassware being poured out decreases (aligning with global y (up) axis with applied wobble), and the fluid level in glassware being poured into increases similarly; the rates were tuned to look correct to the user, the actual volumes involved were not calculated, so are not expected to be correct.

The total pressure in the trap vacuum chamber is typically in the 10 -3 Torr range (mostly Ar), monitored using a capacitance manometer with resolution of ~10 -6 Torr, and the chamber base pressure is ~10 Torr, monitored by a cold cathode ionization gauge (turned off during experiments).",
  "The seasonal variation of environmental pharmaceutical levels has gained few accounts in the literature. For example, analysed a large data set from different seasons and inspected the fate of antibiotics in an icecovered river. To our knowledge, no significant emphasis has been put on a quantitative assessment that aims to generalise the extent of the seasonal variation. To provide insight and numerical tools into this topic, we analyse the literature data for general trends of seasonal dependency in a collection of WWTP removal efficiencies and pharmaceutical concentrations in the environment. This is augmented by degradation assessment via environmental fate modelling, and the correspondence of its results with the litera-ture data is discussed. We communicate the analysis in a chronological order from the source WWTP process to emission levels in aquatic environments, and finally present the FATEMOD-Q modelling results for comparison. The applied methods and model are shown to help understand the temporal behaviour of contaminants on seasonal and also shorter timescales.",

In light of these very encouraging results, functionality tests on cells were performed to evaluate the behavior of this new indium polymer in biological media and staining conditions.",
  "The SDC exhibits heightened sensitivity, especially when the standard deviation is low (Figure ). A smaller σ leads to a more sharply defined and concentrated Gaussian distribution around the mean energy value.

  "We then verified that non-NMC redox capacity regained via the low voltage hold does not result from a different, non-passivating reduction reaction, such as reduction of the original SE. Extending the duration of the voltage hold past 66 h does not increase the Coulombic efficiency beyond 96.2% (Fig. ). Because the upper bound is below 100%, we confirm that capacity arises solely from reduction of SE oxidation products and NMC relithiation.",
  "A series of software and programs were used to produce dispersion and population plots computationally. First, the geometry of every cluster structure is optimized, and a Hessian calculation is performed on the equilibrium geometry (ORCA program suite). This Hessian is then converted into (redundant) internal coordinates to identify internal rotations (i.e., those modes, which only have changes in dihedral angles). Here, we only consider internal rotations around ion-solvent binding axes.",
  "We evaluated the quality of our AAM algorithm with the previously published \"Golden\" dataset 2 . We compared AAM with IBM RxnMapper As the AAM in RxnMapper is based on SMILES sequences does the order of the sequence influence the errors. Interestingly, the mapper pays high attention to '=C' substrings on both sides of the reaction and marks these atoms as the same. In opposite, the graph-based attention is invariant to the atom order and does not use bond order information, and works with full neighbors context, which can be seen in the table above. For example, atom 1 (rows) in the product has high and correct equal attention to atoms 1 and 9 (columns). A similar pattern is observed for all atoms.",
  "The heating efficiency of the IONPs was conducted via AC magnetometry experiments. This method was preferred when compared to classical calorimetry experiments to avoid errors rising from non-adiabatic conditions (thermal losses towards the environment) and to study several AMF conditions, within reasonable experimental time. In this case, an AC magnetic field is applied through a commercial resonant circuit (Nanotech Solutions, Madrid, Spain), inducing the rotation of magnetic moments of the NPs to follow the applied field but with a phase lag. This phase lag induces the opening of a dynamic hysteresis loop when plotting the instantaneous IONP magnetization Mt vs. the applied field Ht at time t recorded at a given frequency f and alternating magnetic field amplitude Hmax.",
  "While the pore properties and operating conditions could be adjusted to potentially permit a better identification of amplicons from this commercial PCR mixture, the sensing conditions are far from optimized. Analysis is also complicated by the large number of events detected and the propensity of pore to clog that severely limits the nanopore lifetime and lowers experimental yield. To overcome these limitations, a homebrew PCR mixture was developed to be better suited to solidstate nanopore operation.",

  "The plausible mechanism of the triazenolysis sequence for norbornene 1a and triazene 2b is depicted on Scheme 3. The transformation commences with the generation of triazadienium 8 from triazene 2b. The former undergoes a [3+2] cycloaddition with the alkene, yielding nitrenium salt 3b (step 1). The Lewis acidic 3b is then reduced to the corresponding elusive N-H triazane 9 by hydride abstraction from NaBH4. This triazane is presumably unstable and may undergo retrocycloaddition to produce imine functionality and diaza-Criegee zwitterion in one molecule (species 10). Further reduction with sodium borohydride, present in the solution, yields the product 4b (step 2).",

  "However, these cells operated at relatively low current densities (≤ 0.3 mA cm -2 ) and required hot pressing current collectors onto LLZO at temperatures > 900 °C for fabrication. Other work has investigated anode-free SSBs using the softer Li6PS5Cl (LPSC) SSE , finding that performance was limited by the poor deposition morphology of lithium at intrinsic current collector interfaces. This led to the incorporation of a Ag-C layer between the current collector and SSE, which facilitated uniform deposition. Although these cells exhibited excellent performance , the relatively thick mediator layers reduce energy density. Despite these advances, much is still unknown about how the plating and stripping mechanisms at interfaces with zero initial lithium metal differ from interfaces with excess lithium metal, which are much more commonly studied.",

  "FIG. illustrates the O:H-O coupling potentials for water and its extension to X:R-Y for, but not limited to, the following scenarios. The first scenario is electron lone pair (:) engagement (X = F, O, N; Y = X, C; R is less electronegative to ensure the R-Y dipole pointing away from the \":\") for water and CHNO molecular assemblies. The second scenario involves dipolar substitution (X = M p , V 0 , H2Osurf, OH -ads, etc.) for the X: by an atomic dipole M P , an atomic vacancy V 0 , or the undercoordinated H2Osurf and OH -ads adsorbed on hetero-coordinated support such as oxides as well with excessive charge quantity on oxygen, for molecular physisorption and efficient catalysis.

  "While vanadyl is frequently used as a mimic for fleeting Fe(IV)=O in C-H activation, we showed through a combination of DFT geometry optimizations and accurate WFT energetics that there are crucial differences between ferryl and vanadyl intermediates that could be rationalized in terms of differences in their ground spin states. Crucially, the most favorable bidentate M(IV)=O isomer is different for Fe and V, and we also found that conversion between monodentate and bidentate isomers of the key metal-oxo/hydroxo intermediates is energetically favorable for Fe but strongly unfavorable in vanadyl mimics.",

  "In conclusion, we have disclosed a practical approach to a sophisticated bifunctional copper(I)/NHC complex based on a mechanochemical protocol. This operationally simple synthetic route circumvents the previously necessary use of surplus transition metal reagents and therefore diminishes unwanted waste formation. The new protocol presented here is based on K 3 PO 4 and has successfully displayed the activity of the resulting catalyst in a variety of hydrogenative transformations. Our results do not only add to the wide area of applications of mechanochemical synthesis but also showcase that transition metal complexes bearing additional functional groups can be prepared with a ball milling synthesis. We think that our protocol could be useful for the atom economic preparation of other complex catalysts, which are difficult or wasteful to be prepared by typical liquid state synthesis methods.",
  "In order to improve the stimulation kinetics, complementary chronoamperometry experiments have been performed on fresh gel samples using a more cathodic applied potential (Eapp = -550 mV vs Ptwire) which allows faster generation of 1 0 at the working electrode vicinity. Using a more cathodic potential reduced by 50% the time required to reach the theoretical charge Qtheo During chronoamperometry. However, this stimulation protocol led to a quick generation of πdimers (increase in Abs870nm) and π-aggregates (increase in Abs1300nm). Unlike the delayed aggregation observed during the gel photoreduction (Figure ), the formation of (1 +• )agg could here clearly be observed during the electrolysis as the average radical concentration remains low ([1 +• ] ~ 0.3 mM for t > 700 s at Eapp = -550 mV).

  "We next computed PMFs for pore formation in the presence of peptides for the CG systems. Because ξ was first developed to bias the oxygen atoms of water molecules and lipid head phosphates for the atomistic Berger and CHARMM36 force fields, we performed several tests comparing PMFs for pure DMPC obtained from biasing MARTINI water beads and DMPC lipid PO4 beads to confirm sufficient membrane size, absence of hysteresis, and convergence (see section S.4 for more details). These comparisons indicate that 288 lipids are sufficient to avoid finite-size artifacts (Figure ), initial configurations sampled from either a forward (ξ = 0.2 to 1.0) or backward (ξ = 1.0 to 0.2) steered molecular dynamics simulation lead to identical PMF profiles (Figure ), and PMF convergence is observed within 20 ns of sampling for each window (Figure ). There is also a PMF minimum near ξ = 0.2 which confirms proper selection of the number of slices of the membrane-spanning cylinder.

  "As representative examples we analyse in more detail characteristic angular and distance dependencies for Au (weak binding) and Pt (strong binding). We start with the corrugation between the top (most stable), bridge (less stable) and hollow (least stable) site on the (111) surface. This corrugation is difficult to reproduce by force fields, since the Lennard-Jones potential (or related pair-wise additive physisorption potentials ) erroneously assign the adsorption minimum to the hollow site. Figure clearly shows that GAL21 retrieves the relative stability quite well, even though the minimum distance for the less stable bridge and hollow positions are, especially for Pt, somewhat underestimated compared to DFT. Comparing to the other metals (Fig. ) confirms that this is a quite general trend.",

In the work about biochar proposed by Tagliaferro et al., the use of GauLors revealed itself relevant for a specific study the evolution of Raman bands according to carbonization temperature. The same can be for q-Gaussians. We have shown that a q-Gaussian is fitting the pseudo-Voigt lineshape, which is a 'computation friendly' version of the physical meaningful Voigt lineshape.",
  "Herein, we developed an original soaking system using ligand-free hSirt2 apo crystals with an open selectivity pocket and favourable crystal contacts. Our new approach allows the efficient characterization of a wide range of Sirt2 inhibitor and substrate binding modes, and facilitates structural analysis of weak-binding molecules (e.g., initial screening hits), which are challenging to study using conventional co-crystallization methods.",
  "During the GTM manifold training, the D 3 parameters were systematically varied (cutoff from 2 to 10 Å and number of bins k from 5 to 30). The parameters values cutoff=3 Å and k=30 found in the grid search were retained for further calculations. For each set of D 3 parameters, GTM parameters were optimized by a dedicated Genetic Algorithm and the one corresponding to minimal energy prediction error and maximum entropy at the Pareto front were selected.",
  "We have shown that highly cooperative materials have particular promise for room temperature bistability. In particular, we found that our model allows room temperature switching in for reasonable parameters. Highly cooperative materials where the HS state remains stable on thermal cycling to low temperatures have clear advantages over switching in the thermal hysteresis loop because of the potential to massively increase the temperature range where bistability is found -a requirement for robust technologies that can operate in varied environmental conditions. Two complimentary strategies to enhance T r-LIESST are to explore more rigid ligands in framework materials and systems with large ∆H. We emphasize the thermally-driven SCO is not required for high-temperature switching and that our results indicate that materials that do not display thermal SCO allow switching between long-lived (meta)stable states to the highest temperatures.",
  "These results raise the question of how a purposefully introduced guest end group affects the balance of competing supramolecular interactions. To this end, we attached AAP as a photoswitchable end group. Previous work has shown that differently substituted AAPs can exhibit varying binding constants with β-CD. As low and moderately binding guests are expected to be more significantly affected by competition, unsubstituted AAP was identified as an interesting candidate and selected to be studied in competition with CPA. Using ITC, we compared the binding interactions with AAP-POEGMA31-CPA and AAP-PGMA34-CPA.",
  "Two proteins were used to test the AMBER FF extension to the st-CpHMD method (Table S3 of Supporting Information): Lysozyme (HEWL; pdbid: 4LZT) and Staphylococcus aureus nuclease (SNase; pdbid: 1STN). All systems were solvated in a rhombic dodecahedral box with periodic boundary conditions. The PypKa webserver was used to estimate an initial number of counter ions to add at each pH value (Table of Supporting Information) and all charge fluctuations were corrected by the PME background charge correction in GROMACS.",
  "chiral isomers. This approach could be further improved towards the single-molecule level upon creating a confinement . However, developing an accessible method for identifying peptides containing chiral amino acids remains cumbersome. The chirality-contain peptides break the sidechain zig-zag alignment , which renders circular-dichroism based approaches ineffective in identifying. Both approaches highly rely on synthetic benchmarks. Thus, no single-molecule technique is available that easily distinguishes chiral amino acids even positional isomers in single peptides.",
  "Encouraged by these results, we replaced the phenol moiety by bulky naphthol ( , Ad, L 16 ) at both C3 and C6 position of the naphthol ring. Pleasingly, L 15 was found to be optimal to give 3aa in 65% yield with 46% ee and 68:32 dr, while over-congested Ad group led to a depreciation in both yield and enantioselectivity. Nevertheless, there's still plenty room for improvement of selectivity.",
  "Transmission electron microscopy (FEI Tecnai G2 F20 Supertwin) images of the nanoparticles after workup were obtained by depositing 10 µL of dilute solution in toluene onto holey carbon TEM grids (Ted Pella Lacey carbon on 400 mesh Cu) and allowing the solution to air dry. Before imaging, samples were further dried under vacuum overnight. Scanning electron microscopy (ThermoFisher Scientific Apreo) images were taken of Ni2P films on carbon fiber. Powder X-ray diffraction (Bruker D8 Discover with Pilatus 100K 2D detector) was performed on as-synthesized Ni2P nanoparticles on silicon wafers and the annealed Ni2P-loaded 2×2 cm 2 carbon fiber squares.",
  "More generally, our monitoring design findings are conservative with respect to realized campaigns, which may perform worse than the designs tested here. Field campaigns often incorporate multiple features that can limit their ability to assess long-term population exposures, including monitoring for less than a year, collecting few repeat visits per location (median ~4), sampling exclusively during weekday business hours, and collecting a variable number of measurements per location .",
  "The single cell was obtained and mounted on a Calcium fluoride substrate as per the previously mentioned procedure . For the Raman imaging using WITec confocal micro-Raman spectrometer, the step size of the scan was kept at around 0.3 microns with a 5 second laser exposure time. The Raman hyperspectral imaging spectral data was preprocessed via routine procedures involving denoising, baseline correction and normalization. Raman images based on SMCO tracer bands were generated using in-house codes and k means cluster analysis using MATLAB 2021B software. Other plots related to hyperspectral data were generated using Origin Pro 2023b Software.",
  "Therefore, this model for the first time shows the importance of A g state as the intermediate for SF process and explains the experimental observations quite succinctly. It explains the experimental observation of A g like peaks at intermediate timescales in transient absorption spectra on the way to a coupled-TT state formation. The presence of A g states as intermediates along with CT states for the polyene system, shows the crucial difference of SF mechanism in carotenoids as compared to acenes.",
  "The QTP02 functional from the Quantum Theory Project 13 is also a range-separated hybrid with full exact exchange at long range. That feature is correct in atoms and small molecules, but not in solids where the needed fraction of exact exchange at long range is the inverse of the bulk dielectric function, a global material-dependent parameter (which vanishes in a metal). The LYP correlation in QTP02 is also incorrect for metals. The QTP02 parameters are not material-dependent but are determined using conditions that for a hybrid functional are implied by a correct linear variation 3 of the total energy as a function of fractional average electron number in the system between any two adjacent integers (an effect observed for SIC-LSDA, but not for LSDA, before its exact derivation in ref 3). Because the linear variation cannot be achieved exactly for all systems by a hybrid functional with a finite number of parameters, two parameters were trained on a few small molecules, including some that contain a 3d atom. Tests on eleven small organic molecules have demonstrated that minus the occupied QTP02 orbital energies are impressively close to reference vertical ionization energies with a mean absolute deviation of 0.36 eV in Table of ref 13.",
  "At intermediate powers the decays can be described by adding a second exponential decay with lifetime τxx, shown in Figure . These bi-exciton lifetimes are quite short, in the range of 5 to 60 ps and correspond to Auger Constants (AC=V 2 (8 τxx) -1 ) 31 in the range of 0.05 to 1 (x10 30 ) cm 6 s -1 (see Figure ). The values are in line with previous measurements on InP/ZnSe1-xSx core shell QDs 2 as well as with the universal size-dependent trend of Auger constants proposed by Robel et al. . This shows that the scaling of Auger recombination in these small InP coreonly QDs is similar to that of other QD materials.",
  "It has become evident that, by reducing the number of aromatic rings in a drug candidate, the likelihood of clinical success can be increased. Greater fractions of sp 3 centers enabled access to new chemical space, potentially enhancing drug selectivity, with a positive impact on physicochemical properties, namely solubility and metabolic stability. Despite the Figure : Overview of the research study. Screening plate design: Minisci literature data containing metalfree reactions were extracted and analyzed to determine suitable reaction conditions. For parallel reaction screening, 23 sp 3 -rich carboxylic acids with relevance for drug discovery were included. Reaction data generation: Using the reaction plate design, physical experiments in high-throughput experimentation (HTE) fashion were conducted with marketed drugs and fragments from an informer library (184 reactions ) covering relevant chemical space. In addition, 16 distinctly non-reactive substrates were screened for in silico decoy data generation (368 reactions). Geometric deep learning: The obtained reaction data (SURF, Simple User-friendly Reaction Format) were subjected to geometric deep learning, incorporating 3D structural information of the chemicals. The trained model was applied to 3000 building blocks from the Roche library, with a particular focus on electron-deficient heterocycles. This in silico screening predicted the reactivity of the compounds for substrate ranking and clustering. Validation and application: The prediction models were experimentally validated for a diverse set of 18 building blocks. Selected scale-up reactions led to fully characterized compounds. availability of guidelines for reactivity prediction for Minisci-type transformations, the limited scope of functional groups tolerated, as well as the varying types of C-H bonds and electronic effects in a complex molecule makes the prediction of alkylation reactions difficult. . Performing individual reactions on a typical medicinal chemistry scale (milligram scale) to augment the reaction database with relevant transformation examples would be a time-and resource-intensive endeavour, with a rather limited value-to-effort ratio.",
  "The lattice matching procedure relies solely on lattice parameters, with no consideration of interatomic interactions and bonding at the interface. To assess if any of the identified epitaxial relations can produce a chemically stable interface, an exhaustive set of atomistic models must be constructed and ranked by relative energy. To this end, Ogre cleaves the two materials at",
  "Asymmetric salt concentration (ASC) conditions, in which a nanopore separates two reservoirs of different salt concentrations, offer a flexible method to probe the dynamics of transport through nanopores. Previous publications have shown that ASC conditions provide a simple method by which to decouple capture rate and translocation velocity; Measurements with molecules in the cis side being in a lower salt concentration than the trans side (Ctrans/Ccis > 1)",
  "Franssen et al., summarising LEAF benefits in the Netherlands, see a risk of future 'goal displacement' such that increasing sustainability may become less important than 'scoring high' in certification when it becomes required. They reference to former 'assessment systems affecting money or reputation' that have changed researchers' behaviours (e.g. bibliometric measures) towards a culture of scoring high rather than performing better. If labs want to greenwash, they can currently do so, as there is no external validation of the certifications, such as an external audit.",
  "The voltage and current density traces over time (Figure ,b) reflected a PEDOT:PSS film charging and discharging in a capacitive manner with relatively flat current plateaus. The potential range was limited to ±0.6 V vs Ag/AgCl, as the applied voltages were low enough to avoid electrolyte breakdown yet large enough to probe the range of reproducible scattering peak shifts. Plotted as current density versus potential (Figure ), the cyclic voltammograms display a capacitive hysteresis common to PEDOT:PSS films cycled over similar potential ranges. The out-of-plane lamellar scattering peak displayed the largest change during cycling, shifting to higher qz toward the negative extreme (E < 0 V vs Ag/AgCl) of the dedoping (reduction) sweep, returning to lower qz during initial doping (oxidation)",
  "The adsorption behavior of chlorine on the Mg(0001) surface takes an intriguing turn when additional Cl atoms are introduced after reaching full monolayer coverage (Θ = 1.0). We have been looking for the onset of the formation of a MgCl 2 layer on Mg(0001) by using an efficient yet computationally inexpensive optimization algorithm called adaptive random mutation hill climbing (ARMHC) .",
  "It is important to note that in the COHP scheme, the Fock matrix F(k ) is used in order to sample over the indexed band structure in reciprocal space, while the overlap matrix S(k ) analogue constitutes the COOP method, which instead of providing the energy of the interaction of groups l and m, details the character of the interaction (bonding, antibonding, order). In order to ensure consistency with the gas-phase dimer calculations employed for electron-phonon couplings, the COHP analysis relies on crystalline wavefunctions obtained with the more accurate hybrid PBE0 53 functional and the same def2-SVP basis set (vide infa). Reevaluation of the solid-state models in this manner produced electronic structures and relative expansion coefficients in excellent agreement with the gas-phase simulations using the same theoretical parameters. In order to ensure that only the neighboring desired groups for COHP projections were captured, all calculations described in the COHP methodology here use expanded supercells of the crystalline unit cells employed for vibrational analyses.",

  "H 2 CO to H 3 CO. Formaldehyde preferably adsorbs at the interface with its carbon attached to the Zn site and the oxygen on a Zr top site. The hydrogens of the H 2 CO are bent away from the interface leaving the carbon with an sp 3 -like geometry which shows that the formaldehyde is electronically activated. The reacting H is again sitting on the metal component.",
  "Using a flame-polished glass pipette, 1 mL of ethereal DZM was transferred into standard and Liberty ® sample vials, with 0.5 mL being used for canola samples. TrEnDi-derivatized samples were dried down to completeness using a stream of N2 (g) and reconstituted in water + caffeine internal standard (0.5 μM) prior to analysis via LCMS, or methanol for analysis using nano-electrospray (ESI)-MS and MS and immediately stored at 4 °C.",
  "The time-consuming task of constructing G µν and Gµν in the respective DFT and TDDFT calculations entails the Coulomb and HF exchange contributions, thereby imposing a computational and storage bottleneck resulting from the O(N 4 ) complexity of ERIs. Thus, to avoid heavy storage overhead, an integral-driven and direct scheme for the construction of the Fock matrix is inevitably used, in which ERIs are calculated as needed, and subsequently, they are immediately contracted using the one-electron density matrix (refer to Supplementary Text 3). For achieving an efficient Fock build with multi-GPUs, a concurrent evaluation for the batches of ERIs is a key requirement. Certain ERI algorithms, such as McMurchie and Davidson , Head-Gordon and Pople , and Rys 48 , were applied as GPU extensions . However, as widely anticipated, ERI implementations based on recursion relations are generally suited for treating low angular momenta integrals featuring AOs of l ≤ 1, largely due to the limited memory of GPU, while the Rys quadrature scheme, which computes the ERI by n-point numerical integration, where n is determined by the half-sum of the angular momenta of the AOs, is regarded suitable for GPU implementation, and hence, is adopted in the present work.",
  "Phase identification of the BDD-V2O5 electrodes prior to and after lithiation were investigated using grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (XRD; Malvern Panalytical Empyrean 3 with multicore optics (iCore/dCore), giving Cu Ka radiation). The incident beam was narrowed using a 1/16° slit to minimise beam spread at low angle. A parallel plate collimator with a solid state Pixcel 3D detector operating as a point detector (0D) mode was used with a step size of 0.03° 2q. Prior to measurement, the sample surface was adjusted so that it was flat and cut the direct X-ray beam in half, assuring that the sample was in the centre of rotation of the goniometer. An incident angle of 2° was used. The grazing incidence XRD data were analysed using the Panalytical HighScore Plus software (v4.8) and the peaks matched against reference patterns from the latest ICDD database. To aid the pattern matching, the elements were restricted to just V, H, O. The diamond peaks were also accounted for.",
  "Further reductive hydrogenation on one of the bound carbons would break the symmetry producing a *CHCHCH2. Beyond this both bound hydrogens would need a PCET to produce propylene. Both of these would be expected to be facile, but we would expect the vinylic carbon to have a PCET first followed by the allylic carbon based on electronegativity differences. The produced propylene would be expected to desorb readily from the copper surface, preventing further reduction to propane.",
  "The above cluster models were optimized at the density functional theory level in Gaussian 16 software program using the M06-L 48 local exchange-correlation density functional. The def2SVP basis set was used for O, C, and H, while the def2TZVPP basis set was used for the catalytic metals and the support metal (Zr). The SDD effective-core pseudopotential was used for metals present beyond the fourth row of the periodic table to enhance the computational efficiency. Vibrational frequencies were computed in the rigid rotor harmonic oscillator (RRHO) approximation for the optimized structures to determine the nature of the stationary point and to compute the entropic contribution to the free energies. No imaginary frequencies were determined for the intermediates (minimum on the potential energy surface), while only one imaginary frequency along the reaction coordinate was determined for the transition states. All frequencies below 50 cm -1 were corrected to 50 cm -1 to avoid errors due to anharmonicity. Different possible spin states corresponding to the oxidation state of each transition metal were considered and only the spin state lowest in energy are reported here.",
  "where h represents a small displacement from λ = 0. We used h = 0.01 with the findiff Python package and a general accuracy of 2. This requires evaluating the energies for systems at non-integer λ values; in other words, PySCF calculations on a reference atom with a conventional nuclear charge of Z used nuclear charges of Z, Z ± 0.01, and Z ± 0.02.",
  "Some works even completely circumvent the sampling by training a surrogate model alongside the wavefunction that can cheaply predict energies at inference time . This way, transferable wavefunctions bridge the gap between ML and ab initio models. Other approaches to speed up the training of neural wavefunctions include more efficient sparse implementations of the Laplace operator, which currently is the bottleneck in the training pipeline as well as better optimizers .",
  "To investigate more features of the QCaRA-based reaction-path networks, the network including base-catalysed aldol reaction was further investigated. The obtained network is shown in Figure , where nodes and edges represent EQs and reaction paths, respectively, and the nodes are coloured based on the theoretical yields of the target product of the reaction starting from each node."
