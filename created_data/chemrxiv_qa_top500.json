Interestingly, a distinct peak appears around ~ 100 cm -1 for the pure MM cations contribution, while the II contribution clearly exhibits two main bands. In both cases, the MI contribution closely resembles the anion's movements.

This results in a reduction of sites with ideal symmetry for the FAOR, slowing the onset of the reaction, but the increase in terrace areas and the positive effects of OHad interactions contribute to a higher relative FAOR rate at high overpotential.",
    "context": "At higher potentials that permit rapid adsorption, high coverages of HCOOad will be reached. The associated increase in peak currents for r-catalysts could partly be attributable to higher overall populations of (111)-domains and the (pure chemical) turnover rate upon those facets. However, we hypothesize that beneficial adsorbate-adsorbate interactions with OHad (populating defect sites), Complementing insights from Pb-UPD experiments, we observed that most of the thiols promoted an etching of low-coordinated features and large defects, enlarging (111)-surface ensembles, though likely leaving significant residual defects such as adatoms and vacancies. These defects in turn lead to a reduction in site ensembles having ideal symmetry for the FAOR (slowing onset), but the larger quantity of terraces and some synergistic benefit to highly dispersed defects ultimately raises the rel-RFAOR at high overpotential.
