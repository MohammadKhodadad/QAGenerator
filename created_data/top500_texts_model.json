For numerical simulations, the condition κ G > 1 implies that ergodicity has not been reached on a given length of simulation t sim .",
  "Hardware simulations reveal a statistically consistent performance with noiseless classical simulations utilizing the same quantum circuit (Fig. ). The study explores the efficacy of the VQE algorithm through Trotterized implementations of unitary CCSD (qUCCSD), entanglement forging (EF), 295 and qubit coupled cluster (QCC). The calculated energy The ORR on Pt and Co@Pt surfaces, was studied using the ADAPT-VQE algorithm 270 on the H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer. Static correlation exploration involved a complete active space approach on quantum hardware, while dynamic correlation was addressed with second-order perturbation theory (QRDM NEVPT2). The selection of the active space utilized the automatic regional embedding variant of the automatic valence active space (AVAS/RE) method. analysis, traditional CAS notations, and the assurance that AVAS active orbitals were localized on O and the nearest Pt atoms. A smaller Hamiltonian was then formed with a (2e,3o) active space, compatible with hardware. The initial state preparation involved the use of ADAPT-VQE and (k=1)-UpCCGSD. Reference converged DFT calculations demonstrated accurate results for the pure Pt catalyst with a small active space, while the Pt/Co catalyst required a larger active space to capture correlation energy, confirming strong correlation in the magnetic core-shell system.",
  "X-ray diffraction. Powder diffraction patterns were collected using Cu Kα X-rays (1.54 Å) on a PANalytical X'Pert Pro X-ray diffractometer in Bragg-Brenano (reflection) geometry up to a 2θmax≈80° (qmax≈ 5.2 Å -1 ). The air sensitive Li2+xS1-xNx probes were loaded into air-tight holders in an Ar-filled glovebox prior to the measurements. GSAS-II and FullProf 37 (through the user interface implemented in the \"Match!\" software) were used for LeBail and Rietveld refinements.",
  "Originally these two belts were flexible PCBS with a 30member array of partially overlapping oval trans-axial lenses , each 18 mm high and a relative +30 V applied. Again, due to the difficulty mounting and aligning such a PCB structure, this was replaced by solid metal belts, with a single potential per side and the lensing effect generated by 0.5mm deep circular protrusions. Conductive rods were also installed bridging the inner and outer belts between the entrance points to the first three lenses, creating an effective aperture to clip stray ions.",
  "where \"cc\" means current collector and \"solv\" means the species is in the solvated state (in solution). This reaction creates a surface layer of Sr 1-x IrO 3 proposed to contain Ir(VI). Previous studies showed that Sr leaching leads to the formation of an OER-active defect-rich IrO x surface layer in acidic electrolytes .",
  "In the evaluation of object detection alone (Metric I, Fig. ), 3 different outcomes are possible through the course of region proposal and object detection: RoIs represented as Elow and Ehigh predicted by the RPN could ultimately align with ground truth of redox bounds (object detection true positive, tp1; when IoU ≥ 0.75 between the algorithm-yielded proposed redox voltage window and the corresponding ground truth) or not (object detection false positive, fp1), and regions where known true redox bounds were not detected were assigned as false negatives (fn).",
  "The oligomer took a canonical B-DNA form and was constructed using Amber's NAB tool. Chargeneutralizing Na + counterions and a spherical water cap with a radius of 30.0 Åwere subsequently added with Amber's LEaP program. The SPC/Fd 87 flexible force field was used for the surrounding water molecules, while the parmbsc1 88 force field was used for DNA. Sodium counterions use the Joung-Cheatham parameters. To generate thermally sampled molecular structures, initially, the entire system was treated with MM force fields and classical dynamics was run for 60 ps at 300 K with a Langevin thermostat using sander in Amber 2018. DNA atoms were restrained to the idealized B-DNA structure using a force constant of 1,000 kcal/mol/ Å2 , so that only thermal fluctuations in the liquid environment were sampled. 20 solute-solvent configurations were chosen at intervals of 0.5 ps from the MD trajectory following a 50-ps equilibration period. These geometries seeded the QM/MM optimizations, which were done with MM atoms frozen to prevent an unphysical quench in energy from relaxing the surrounding solvent molecules. QM-charge-neutral geometry optimizations were initially done with Restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF-D3) QM/MM. Next, with the optimized charge-neutral structures as input, diabatic optimizations for the localized hole states shown in Fig. were performed.",
  "Synthesis of neonorhalichondrin B began from 2-deoxy-L-ribose to generate alkene 12, following literature procedure. Ozonolysis and Wittig homologation then yielded unsaturated ester 13, which was subsequently subjected to DIBAL reduction and chlorination to give allylic chloride 14. Sharpless dihydroxylation of the allylic chloride using (DHQD)2AQN as the chiral ligand afforded diols 15/15b in 7:1 dr. Cyclization of diols 15/15b using NaOH followed by TES protection furnished epoxide coupling partner 10 and its epimer 10b as an inseparable mixture.",
  "The CMMS isotherm considers primary adsorption sites to be characterized by an affinity parameter K0 that represents Henry's law and characterizes adsorbate-adsorbent (fluid-solid) interaction .

The CMMS model meets this requirement which is indicated as a limit at low relative pressure on Table .",
  "Direct simulations of water surrounding charged C 60 fullerens 42 also show an increase in the interfacial dielectric constant when going from a positive to negative charge q (Figure ), followed by an interfacial phase transition of water restructuring and releasing O-H bonds at sufficiently negative density of free surface charge (spike in Figure ).",
  "We found a negligible effect of membrane crossover on AQDS symmetric cells with as-received membranes, indicating that the crossover fluxes present in many symmetric cell studies of aqueous organic flow batteries are not sufficiently high as to affect measured capacity fade rates. However, the higher crossover fluxes through pretreated NR211 and NR212 caused increased symmetric cell capacity fade with increased crossover.",
  "where G SP is the Gibbs free energy for the Schottky pair formation, K SP (T ) denotes the Schottky product.

  "The ECFP4NN baseline model combined three MLPs for input transformation, namely the ECFP4 fingerprint and two embedded reaction conditions (i.e., solvent and ligand). The ECFP4 feature dimension was set to 256 after screening the feature dimensions in the range of 2 7 -2 10 . Additional baseline experiments using binary reaction fingerprints with two popular decision tree algorithms, gradient boosting and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) can be found in SI (SI10).",
  "Thus, we think it is worth developing a more intuitive and conceptional understanding on these stacking sequences and what symmetry must / can result from them. Such symmetry considerations are well developed for perovskite materials related to the cubic aristotype (tilting variants and ordering variants) and very helpful, and next to space group analysis with groupsubgroup relations there are also concepts easier to visualize in someone's mind, e.g., the Glazer notation .",
  "The high stability (and isostericity) of the Pur P -Ag + -C cWW-like pair observed in this DFT analysis is also observed in PEX reactions conducted with the Kf (exo -) polymerase since, when Pur P acts as an incoming triphosphate, formation of the mispair is only observed in the presence of Ag + (Fig. ).",
  "Pittsburgh site measures daily EC only 1-in-3 days as a part of the CSN network. Availability of sparse daily data limits the capability of the model to predict hourly BC at a high accuracy.

We have provided as well the first preliminary results of biorecognition signal using sybody-modified silicon nanonet-FETs and compared to FETs with antibodies in the low picomolar levels, showing a similar performance. Further experiments in lower target concentrations and higher ionic strength using diluted buffer instead of DI water can help gaining further insights on the performance difference in shorter Debye lengths.",
  "Regional spectra were 0.1 eV point spacing and higher energy resolution E-pass = 50 eV. The XPS data were analyzed using Avantage 5.99 software. A Smart background function was used to approximate the experimental background. Scofield Al Kα sensitivity factors were used to calculate relative atomic percentages. All XPS spectra were plotted using Origin Pro.",
  "The success of the linear scaling relationship implies that the most important structures in the chemical reaction network are all approximately functions of a single independent variable, 𝐺 EI & (𝒙). This simplifies the chemical network and collapses the disorder space both into one independent variable. A search procedure for optimality is then argmin",
  "In summary, we investigated the interaction between Magainin 2 (MG2)-loaded atomically precise Au 144 (M P A) 60 MPC and cancer cell membrane using coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics (MD) and umbrella sampling simulations.

  "The protonation of *OCCO -on the oxygen end is kinetically preferred over the sterically hindered C-H bond formation. The resulting *OCCOH can now undergo two viable reaction steps, either the second oxygen is protonated via a PCET forming *HOCCOH, or OH -can desorb, leading to a ketene intermediate *CCO, which stands up perpendicular to the surface.",
  "Systematically performed analysis of Schwarzites demonstrates that the bottom-up synthesis utilizing strategically selected heptagon or octagon trimers, holds greater potential for controlling wider array of topology, geometry, and pore size distribution in periodic carbon materials compared to templating on zeolites. Specific synthetic approaches must be devised and tested, with the major challenge being the assembly of chambers into periodic structures. Understanding topology and symmetry provides with guiding principles needed to succeed in synthesis.",

  "For the TA 1 receptor, because there is no reported structure in the PDB database, structures for the receptor were predicted using Uni-Fold. The sequence of TA 1 receptor was downloaded from GPCRdb . JackHMMER with MGnify , JackHMMER with UniRef90 , and HHBlits with Uniclust30 + BFD were used to search homology sequences to generate multiple sequence alignment(MSA). HHsearch was used to search structure templates from structures that were released before April 29th, 2020. MSA and the top 4 templates were combined as input and 100 models were generated. The activation states were determined by the degree of outward movement of TM6. Active and inactive state structures were selected based on the outward movement of TM6. The side chain of PHE195 5.43 was pointed to the center of TM bundles as reported . The final membrane system was built with 102090 atoms consisting of 220 POPCs, 22290 water molecules, 204 counter ions, and the protein. Ligand 1 (Ulotaront) was docked into the orthosteric binding site. The docking pose was carefully selected to reproduce interactions reported in the publication."
