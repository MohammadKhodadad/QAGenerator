  "After extensive computational studies, we found that concerted, asynchronous desaturation of 2 by 30 to afford 1 and 37 had the lowest energy barrier. By way of comparison, the transition state from β-hydride to O of 30 (Figure , right, TS-B, 27.1 kcal/mol) is favored by 3.6 kcal/mol relative to β-hydride to N of 30 (Figure , left, TS-A, 30.7 kcal/mol), likely due to the fact that oxoammonium 30 resides in a boat conformation with hydrogen bonding to the substrate. Based on DFT calculations (r 2 SCAN-3C/CPCM (CH2Cl2)) Bobbitt's salt 30 itself (right inset, Figure ) appears to be in a stabilizing boat conformation with interaction between the amide and oxoammonium which differs from its solid-state structure. We believe In order to achieve the asymmetric synthesis of 1, acylative kinetic resolution (AKR) using (2S, 3R)-Hyper-BTM catalyst 38 was next evaluated (Scheme 3). While direct AKR on 1 gave poor enantioselectivity (70:30 er), AKR on 2 using isobutyric anhydride showed optimal enantioselectivity (50 % conversion, 42 % yield, >99:1 er) to afford (-)-40 and (+)-2. Unfortunately, (-)-ester 34 gave a 1:3 ratio of (-)-2 and (-)-3 after mild saponification conditions. Fortunately, we found that (-)-34 and (-)-40 were viable desaturation substrates using oxoammonium salt 30. Finally, (-)-1 was saponified using K2CO3/MeOH 7 (Figure ). Interestingly, desaturation of (+)- Although the detailed mechanism is unknown, we believe that at high temperatures, excess Bobbitt's salt 30 may form an adduct (+)-43 with (+)-1 which may be followed by thermal retro-6-6-electrocyclization via triene 44 which partially racemizes substrate 1 (Figure ). A proposed, stabilized alcohol-Bobbitt's salt adduct has been reported by the Rutjes group. A DFT model (Figure ) showed that adduct (-)-43 is stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonding. We also conducted a showed the disappearance of the allylic hydroxyl signal of 1 after treatment with 30. In order to probe the selectivity for AKR of the enantiomers of substrate 2, we also conducted a computational study (r 2 SCAN-3C/CPCM (CH2Cl2)) for transition states of isobutyrylated hyper-BTM catalyst 45 with (-)-2 and (+)-2, respectively. A transition state model (TS-C) of 45 with (-)-2 clearly showed an n-to-cation interaction of the chromenone oxygen to 45 (distance 3.15 Å, Figure ) while the transition state model (TS-D) of 45 with (+)-2 has poor alignment due to steric hindrance. Only a -to-cation interaction of the alkene of (+)-2 to 45 is allowed in the latter transition state (distance 3.17 Å, Figure ). As a result, the energy barrier for acylation and formation of (-)-40 is 14 kcal/mol lower than that of (+)-40.",
  "The rate performance of the (MoS 2 /Ti 3 C 2 T x /CNTs)x3 heterostructure was investigated at 0.05. 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 1 and 2.0 A g -1 current rates (Figure ). The corresponding discharge capacities/CE achieved at the end cycle of each rate were 829 mAh g -1 / 100 %, 769 mAh g -1 /100 %, 707 mAh g -1 /99.9 %, 646 mAh g -1 /99.7 %, 611 mAh g -1 /99.8 %, 531 mAh g -1 /99.8 % and 589/99 % mAh g -1 . Upon subsequent cycling at the lowest 0.05 A g -1 current rate, a reversible capacity of 846 mAh g -1 was attained with a CE of 99.9 %. The capacity stabilization over cycling was obvious at the 0.05 A g -1 current rate, as compared with the performance of the (MoS 2 /Ti 3 C 2 T x )x3 heterostructure (Figure ). However, and in agreement with the long-term cycling (Figures 10f), except for the 2 A g -1 cycling rate, the capacity of the (MoS 2 /Ti 3 C 2 T x /CNTs)x3 heterostructure was lower than the capacity of the (MoS 2 /Ti 3 C 2 T x )x3 heterostructure at all rates.",

  "Crystal-to-Crystal Conversion by Exchange of Mn 2+ by Fe 2+ , Co 2+ , Ni 2+ , Cu 2+ , and Zn 2+ . After the formation of Mn-AdDB, the mother liquid was removed with a syringe from the tube. Subsequently, a freshly prepared solution of FeCl2•4H2O (1.6 g, 8.2 mmol, 400 mg/mL), CoCl2•6H2O (1.9 g, 8.2 mmol, 485 mg/mL), NiCl2•6H2O (1.9 g, 8.2 mmol, 484 mg/mL), CuCl2 (15 mg, 0.11 mmol, 3.8 mg/mL), or ZnCl2 (15.6 mg, 1.15 mmol, 3.9 mg/mL) in methanol (4.0 mL) was slowly added to the tube. The tube was sealed by Parafilm, tilted (70° from the base), and left at room temperature for two days. Subsequently, the solution was removed by a syringe. The colorless crystals left in a solution containing CuCl2 gradually became green. For the crystals immersed in solutions containing FeCl2•4H2O, CoCl2•6H2O, and NiCl2•6H2O, the intense color of the solutions prevented observing changes in the color of the crystals during the experiment. After isolation, the crystals appeared orange (FeCl2•4H2O), pink (CoCl2•6H2O), and light green (NiCl2•6H2O). The crystals remained colorless after the Mn 2+ to Zn 2+ exchange. Finally, the crystals were isolated, washed with methanol (4✕), and were stable at room temperature in methanol for six months.",

  "In addition to national changes, we investigated changes in absolute racial-ethnic exposure disparities from 1990 to 2010 by state and by urban versus rural areas. Most states (>75%) experienced a reduction in racial-ethnic exposure disparities for pollutants except for PM10 (and, except for PM2.5 during 2000-2010) (Fig. , Table ). Urban areas experienced larger reductions in racial-ethnic exposure disparities than did rural areas for NO2 and PM10 (13 larger reductions in urban areas, for both pollutants), CO (2.4), and SO2 (1.2). Conversely, PM2.5 (during 2000-2010) and O3 (during 1990-2010) had larger reductions in absolute racialethnic disparities for rural than for urban (2.4 and 3.4 larger in rural areas, respectively) (Fig. , Table ).",

Besides, 1-(bis(4-fluorophenyl)methyl)piperazine 2j was efficiently converted to the desired product 3j in 86% yield. It is noteworthy that various substitutions of N-atom of piperazine 2k-m were also well tolerated and gave the expected products 3k-m in 84-90% yields. Such scaffolds containing free -OH group are otherwise difficult to access with other methods.

[a] yield too small for quantification [b] insufficient electrophoretic separation of A2 and monomer prevented A2 quantification [c] not determined Next, we investigated the reaction progress of the iron-mediated peptide synthesis in water at 70 °C, for which the peptide yields of the reaction were determined after 1, 3, 7, and 21 -10). G4 was synthesized within 21 d with a yield of 8.7%, G10 was detected as the longest peptide chain. Within 21 d, the yield of each peptide product increased, confirming that longer reaction times not only lead to better yields but also result in longer oligomers. It is important to note that peptide hydrolysis was not observed under these conditions, which agrees very well with kinetic studies. Based on these results, peptide synthesis by iron-mediated amino acid coupling in aqueous medium is a very promising and prebiotically plausible route. In view of the results of our previous studies for peptide synthesis in liquid SO2, we intended to test the applicability of the route to another scenario and transferred the iron-mediated synthesis to this solvent. However, initial experiments with 0.50 eq of iron powder (based on the total amount of amino acids) and an amino acid mixture of G and A with 0.05 eq of AcOH in SO2 at room temperature for 7 d resulted in the formation of only trace amounts of G2 (Figures S9, S181-183).",

In this work, the ECL performance of SA-DMPM-CuNCs was markedly improved after experiencing a simple self-assembly reaction, which was ascribed to the suppressed intramolecular rotation and vibration of ligand DMPM on the compactly packed CuNCs, greatly restraining the nonradiative relaxation.

  "To confirm that neither dissociated dgpy ligand nor the [PF6] -counter ions are potentially reacting with this LMCT state we performed several test reactions. Partial ligand dissociation and consequently the presence of traces of dgpy in the solution as potential substrate could be excluded as [Mn(dgpy)2] 4+ would oxidize uncoordinated dgpy already in its ground state in the dark (Supplementary Fig. ). F and P NMR spectroscopy before and after photolysis confirm that the [PF6] -counter ions are not photooxidized as the NMR spectra remain unchanged after photolysis (Supplementary Figs. 34, 35). To further support the redox innocence of the [PF6] -counter ions, the perchlorate salt [Mn(dgpy)2][ClO4]4 has been prepared and investigated additionally (Supplementary Information). Irradiation of [Mn(dgpy)2][ClO4]4 at 730 nm in CH3CN leads to photoreduction of [Mn(dgpy)2] 4+ as well, even slightly faster than with [PF6] -counter ions (Supplementary Figs. 36, 37). The molar conductivity of [Mn(dgpy)2][PF6]4 in CH3CN is with 640 S cm -1 M -1 comparably high (Supplementary Fig. ), although not many 1:4 electrolytes have been investigated so far hampering comparisons. A molecular dynamics simulation of [Mn(dgpy)2][PF6]4 in CH3CN over 1 µs resulted in shells of counterions with Mn … [PF6] (center-of-mass) distances peaking at 4.1, 6.1, 7.3 and 8.5 Å suggesting ion-pairing with [PF6] - ions (Supplementary Fig. ). Similarly, the molar conductivity of [Mn(dgpy)2][PF6]3 in CH3CN (560 S cm -1 M -1 ) is high for a 1:3 electrolyte (Supplementary Fig. ). To probe the effect of ion paring on the photoreduction and cage escape, [Mn(dgpy)2][PF6]4 was photolyzed in CH3CN in the presence of increasing amounts of [n-Bu4N][PF6] (0, 50, 100 and 200 mM; Supplementary Figs. ). The reaction is significantly slowed down with increasing [PF6] -concentration suggesting a slower photooxidation of CH3CN or a slower cage escape at high ionic strength (Supplementary Fig. ). As the ultrafast dynamics observed by TA spectroscopy are unaffected by the presence of 100 mM [n-Bu4N][PF6] (Supplementary Fig. ), we suggest that the initial static quenching is not hampered but rather the cage escape reaction at high ionic strength. A similar retarding effect on the photoreduction, likely also affecting the cage escape rate, occurs when diluting the acetonitrile solution with redox-inert orthodichlorobenzene in 1:1 and 1:2 v/v ratios (Supplementary Figs. 45-47).",

  "The greenhouse gas selectivity of the tested UU-MOF using the Henry's constants and IAST are presented in Table . The CO2-over-N2 selectivities (CO2:N2 = 15:85) on the UU-MOFs were in the range of 10-15, which was comparable to some other typical sorbents such as activated carbons and some other MOFs such as PCN-88 (15 at 296 K) , ZJNU-44 (15 at 296 K) , and ZJNU-40 (18 at 296 K) . Note that many other CO2 selective sorbents offer much higher selectivities than UU-MOFs including some mixed-linker ZIF-7-8s (23 -33 at 293 K, 47 -90% benzimidazole) , FJI-H14 (51 at 298 K) , and zeolite NaKA (60 -271 at 273 K, ~28% K + ) . The comparatively low CO2 selectivity on UU-MOFs is partly related to the low affinity between the CO2 molecules and the frameworks, as indicated by the linear isotherm shapes. On the other hand, the SF6-over-N2 (SF6:N2 =10:90) selectivity was observed to be high on all samples, ranging from 43-56 at 293 K and 1 bar. The high SF6 selectivity could, as previously mentioned, be attributed to an enhanced molecular interaction between the SF6 molecules and the pore surface of pores with suitable apertures. The SF6/N2 selectivities for UU-MOFs were found to be comparable to other microporous sorbents such as Zn-MOF-74 (46 at 298 K) , ZIF-7-8 containing 26 % benzimidazolate (40 at 293 K) zeolite 13X (43 at 293 K) .",

  "When both substrates are present this clear indication of substrate binding is accompanied by substrate consumption and the generation of the Michael addition product, as monitored using 1 H NMR spectroscopy (Figure , SI S18). An 11% catalyst loading heteroleptic species [Pd2(E-1)2(2)2](BArF)4 converted 24% of the benzoyl nitromethane to the Michael addition product in 10 hours. Having already found that the homoleptic photoswitchable cage [Pd2(E-1)4](BArF)4 is not a catalyst (see above), we also tested whether [Pd3(2)6](BArF)6/[Pd4(2)8](BArF)8 would show any reactivity. These homoleptic species also showed virtually no catalysis, with <1% benzoyl nitromethane going to the product over 10 hours. To ensure [Pd2(E-1)2(2)2](BArF)4 was responsible for the catalysis, control experiments were performed using no catalyst and with [Pd(Py*)4](BArF)2. For both control experiments, no product formation was observed. Crucially, we have also found that the addition of one equivalent of the strongly binding triflate guest to the [Pd2(E-1)2(2)2](BArF)4 catalyzed transformation effectively halts reactivity (SI S19.5). This observation provides further strong support for a mechanism that involves substrate encapsulation.",

  "Next, we explored the scope of the isomerization using 1,4disubstituted cubanes under the optimized reaction conditions. Cubanes bearing two electron-withdrawing groups generally rearranged in high yields to the 2,6-isomer with modest to good selectivity. Reaction of 1-acid-4-methyl ester (1a), 1,4-dimethyl ester (1b), and 1-cyano-4-N,N-diisopropyl amide (1d) cubanes gave excellent selectivity for the 2,6-isomers 2a, 2b, and 2d, respectively, in good yields. Furthermore, the potentially-sensitive bromide group of 2e was also tolerated. However, 1,4-diamide (1c) and 1-amide-4-methylester (1g) cubanes underwent the rearrangement in good yield with poor regioselectivity. When cubanes bearing one electron-withdrawing and one electron-donating group were treated with AgTFA, single 1,3-isomers were produced in moderate to excellent yields. 1methylester-4-hydroxymethyl (1f) and 1,4-dihydroxymethyl (1h) cubanes underwent rearrangement in 99% and 96% yields, respectively, providing 1,3-cuneanes 3f and 3h. Cubanes possessing one electron-withdrawing group and the p-tolyl moiety on the opposite vertex were gratifyingly compatible with the reaction conditions, generating 3i-3k in 92-99% yields. Similarly, the rearrangement of a diaryl cubane (1l) took place efficiently in this reaction system to furnish 3l in quantitative yield. A heteroaryl substituted cubane was easily converted to the corresponding cuneane 3m obtained in 85% yield. Furthermore, this protocol was also compatible on a large scale; conducting the rearrangement with 5 mmol of 1a and 1f afforded the corresponding cuneanes 3a and 3f in 75% and 99% yields, respectively. Unfortunately, the rearrangement was unsuccessful with cubanes bearing -I, -Bpin, and -NHBoc groups, giving either almost no conversion or substrate decomposition to uncharacterized complex mixtures. Additionally, attempted rearrangement of a tri-substituted cubane under these reaction conditions resulted only in unproductive decomposition of the starting material.",
  "Reaction of 1 with sodium provided two types of crystals of close-contact complexes, Na2-6THF-1 2-and Na2-7THF-1 2-(Fig. ).

The diffraction peaks of these phases are consistent with the standard data for CoSe2 (JCPDS: 53-0449, orthorhombic and 09-0234, cubic), suggesting the coformation of both crystal forms during the conversion of Co-MOFs/MX-B, Co-MOFs/MX-S, and Co-MOF-B into CoSe2@C/MX-B, CoSe2@C/MX-S, and CoSe2@C-B, respectively.",

  "9Me2,6DAP and 2,6DAP-d consists of a purine chromophore with double substitution of amino groups at the C2 and C6 positions and a methyl group and a 2'-deoxyribose at the N9 position for 9Me2,6DAP and 2,6DAP-d, respectively (Scheme 1). The substitution at the N9 position effectively prevents N9H and N7H tautomerization, resulting in the biologically relevant single tautomer for both derivatives. In Figure , the molar absorption spectra of 9Me2,6DAP and 2,6DAP-d in MeCN and phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 are depicted. Notably, both compounds display three distinct absorption bands around 280, 256, and 215 nm. In MeCN, 2,6DAP-d has molar absorption coefficients of (9.1 ± 0.1)  10 3 M -1 cm -1 at 280 nm, (8.2 ± 0.1)  10 3 M -1 cm -1 at 256 nm and (2.4 ± 0.1)  10 4 M -1 cm -1 at 217 nm. For 9Me2,6DAP in phosphate buffer at pH 7.4, molar absorption coefficients at the absorption maxima of (9.5 ± 0.1)  10 3 M -1 cm -1 at 280 nm, (7.4 ± 0.1)  10 3 M -1 cm -1 at 257 nm, and (2.6 ± 0.1)  10 4 M -1 cm -1 at 215 nm were measured. For 9Me2,6DAP in MeCN, molar absorption coefficients at the absorption maxima of (9.4 ± 0.1)  10 3 M -1 cm -1 at 280 nm, (8.0 ± 0.1)  10 3 M -1 cm -1 at 257 nm, and (2.8 ± 0.1)  10 4 M -1 cm -1 at 217 nm were measured. The replacement of 9N-methyl group for 2'-deoxyribose induces a minor hyperchromic effect in the absorption spectrum, and the molar absorption coefficients slightly change to (9.6 ± 0.1)  10 3 M -1 cm -1 at 280 nm, (8.6 ± 0.1)  10 3 M -1 cm -1 at 256 nm and (2.3 ± 0.1)  10 4 M -1 cm -1 at 215 nm in phosphate buffer solutions. The emission spectra of 9Me2,6DAP and 2,6DAP-d in MeCN are also shown in Figure . The excitation spectrum collected at the 330 nm emission wavelength satisfactorily match the absorption spectrum of 9Me2,6DAP in MeCN (Figure ). This evidence that the fluorescence emission is an intrinsic property of 9Me2,6DAP. The emission spectra of both 9Me2,6DAP and 2,6DAP-d exhibit maxima at 335  2 nm. The fluorescence quantum yields of 9Me2,6DAP and 2,6DAP-d in MeCN were determined to be practically similar upon excitation at 290 nm, 0.0020 ± 0.0001 and 0.0025 ± 0.0001, respectively, using tryptophan as a standard. In addition, a 0-0 energy of the lowestenergy excited singlet state of 4.13 eV was estimated for both molecules from the crossing point between the absorption and emission spectra in MeCN (Figure ). Figure shows the emission spectra of 9Me2,6DAP and 2,6DAP-d recorded in phosphate buffer at pH 7.4. The emission spectra of both 9Me2,6DAP and 2,6DAP-d exhibit maxima at 352  2 nm or a 17 nm redshift compared to the MeCN solutions. The fluorescence quantum yields were determined in phosphate buffer upon excitation at 290 nm to be 0.0042 ± 0.0001 for 9Me2,6DAP and 0.0058 ± 0.0008 for 2,6DAP-d, respectively, also using tryptophan as a standard. 45 A 0-0 energy of the lowest-energy excited singlet state of 4.09 eV was estimated for both molecules from the crossing point between the absorption and emission spectra in phosphate buffer (Figure ).",
  "Turning to the equivalent BArF salt, we then tested whether the heteroleptic cage [Pd2(E-1)2( )2](BArF)4 could be formed, and in particular, whether it could be generated from the rearrangement of the two homoleptic structures. Homoleptic structures [Pd2(E-1)4](BArF)4 and [Pd3(2)6](BArF)6/[Pd4(2)8](BArF)8 can be assembled with [Pd(Py*)4](BArF)2 in CD3CN, and were characterized by NMR (SI S6.4, S9.4) and ESI-MS data (SI S6.5, S9.5). When a 1:1 mixture of these two homoleptic cages was combined in CD3CN and heated at 50 °C for 30 min, the heteroleptic cage was formed quantitatively (SI S10.5). This indicates that swapping from BF4 to BArF counteranions does not lead to problems of kinetic trapping. However, the solvent that is optimal for this catalysis-dichloromethane-is poorly coordinating and therefore does not promote the rapid ligand exchange required for cage switching. We found that a solvent mixture of 11:1 CD2Cl2/CD3CN, was a good compromise to maximize the host-guest chemistry while providing some coordinating properties to facilitate cage rearrangement (see SI S14, S15).",

  "The aryl iodide scope was then studied for this ortho methoxylation reaction (Fig. ). Beside the simple naphthalene substrate, aryl iodides in various fused structures, such as 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran (4c), dibenzofuran (4d), carbazole (4f), and pyrene (4g), could all give the desired products in good yield. In addition, monocyclic aryl iodides of different electronic properties, e.g., those with electron-donating and -withdrawing groups, also worked well (4h-4w). A wide range of FGs, including fluoro (4h), bromo (4k and 4t), chloro (4o), silyl ether (4l), nitrile (4n), free alcohol (4p), amide (4q), amine (4r), ester (4u) and cyclopropane (4v), were tolerated. Moreover, N-heteroarenebased substrates, such as quinoline (4x), isoquinoline (4y and 4z), and pyridine (4aa-4ac), can smoothly deliver the functionalized methyl ethers. Furthermore, late-stage modification of complex natural products and drugs (4ad-4ag) could be achieved with reasonably good efficiency indicating the generality of this method. Apart from orthosubstituted aryl iodides, para-and meta-substituted ones also reacted, albeit in moderate to low yield (Supplementary Information, Fig. ). The scope of the reagents for functionalizing the ipso position was examined next. Beside tert-butyl acrylate, different Michael acceptors, including methyl acrylate, 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethyl acrylate, and acrylonitrile (4ah-4aj), and styrene (4ak) can be coupled to install diverse alkenyl groups. In addition to the Heck quench, alkynylation and hydrogenation (4al, 4am) are also feasible for the ipso functionalization. Lastly, the deuterated methoxy group (4b) can be introduced in a similar manner with the deuterated electrophile (d-2a). Beyond methoxylation, the coupling with a bulkier alkoxy group appears to be more challenging at this stage due to the increased steric hindrance, though a promising preliminary result has been obtained for the ortho ethoxylation reaction (Supplementary Information, Fig. ). Compared to aryl iodides, aryl bromides are known to be more challenging substrates for the Catellani reactions despite their greater accessibility and lower cost. To our delight, the use of DPEphos as the ligand and KI as an additive (Supplementary Information Table ) allowed various aryl bromides to be competent substrates for the ortho methoxylation (Fig. ). Sensitive FGs, such as aldehyde (4ap), benzothiophene (4aq), benzofuran (4ar), highly strained ether (4as) and amine (4at), were tolerated. Deuterated methoxy group can also be introduced with 5-bromoquinoline (4av).",

  "All materials are also characterized by HAADF-STEM that shows narrowly distributed nanoparticles, whose size depends on Pt/Fe. While monometallic Pt@SiO2 and Fe@SiO2 present particles of 1.8 ± 1.0 nm and 1.5± 0.2 nm respectively, the combination of iron and platinum generally yields smaller nanoparticles (Table ). For instance, Pt1Fe1@SiO2 shows a PSD of 0.7 ± 0.2 nm, indicating a strong interaction between Pt and the Fe promoter. For sufficiently large particles, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) maps show that Pt and Fe profiles strongly overlap, suggesting the formation of Pt-Fe alloys upon H2 reduction (Figure S 37-38). The formation of an alloy is further corroborated by XAS (vide infra) and high-resolution TEM images with lattice spacings consistent with the formation of PtFe alloys, e.g. Pt2Fe1@SiO2 (0.21 nm) vs. Pt3Fe1 bulk-alloy (0.215 nm) and pure-FCC Pt (0.226 nm) (Figure S 39).

The occurrence of pressure dependent features at 2005 cm -1 and 2025 cm -1 hints towards the formation of a Fex(CO)y species, therefore indicating the presence of reduced iron. The extent of the red-shift and the amount of Fex(CO)y species increases with increasing Fe-content (Figure S 28) and is affected by temperature.

The distance for the C2-C3/C6-C7 bonds in 4 were also elongated while the C1-C2/C7-C1 and C3-C4/C5-C6 bond lengths were shorter compared with those of 3a, 13g,13i 3b, and 3c. The bond alternations for the seven-membered ring (ring A) of the 1-hydroxy-4,5benzotropylium derivatives became smaller compared to those of the parent 4,5-benzotropone derivatives, while the bond alternations for the fused benzene ring (ring B) became slightly larger upon protonation. To further evaluate the aromaticity of 3 and 4 in more detail, harmonic oscillator model for aromaticity (HOMA) 16 values were calculated for both the seven-membered ring (ring A) and the fused benzene ring (ring B) of 3a-3c, 4a-4c. The HOMA values for ring A of 4a(0.809), 4b (0.681), and 4c (0.678) were larger compared to those of 3a 13g,13i (-0.019), 3b (0.071), and 3c 14 (-0.015), which are close to zero. Concerning ring B, the HOMA values of 4a-4c were decreased slightly compared to those of 3a-3c but still remained high. These results indicate that the polar resonance form 4B (Chart 1) is the dominant contributor to the structures of 1-hydroxy-4,5-benzotropylium derivatives whereas 3A is more dominant contribution for the 4,5-benzotrones derivatives. The aromaticity of 4 was also assessed by DFT calculations. NICS(1) values of 1-hydroxy-4,5-benzotropylium with no substituents [i.e., 4 (R = H)] calculated at the GIAO-B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p)//B97XD/6-31G(d,p) level were -6.55 and -12.11 for rings A and B, respectively. The diatropicity of heptagonal ring A was significantly increased compared to the parent 4,5benzotropone (-1.06), as was reported for the corresponding tropone/hydroxytropylium system. The contribution of 4B was also supported by anisotropy of induced current density (AICD) calculations, in which a diatropic ring current originating from a 10macrocyclic system was observed (Figure ). In contrast, the AICD plot for 3 (R = H) revealed that a strong diatropic ring current was observed only in the fused benzene ring (ring B), while the seven-membered ring possesses a more polyenic character (Figure ).",

  "Interestingly, applying the reaction conditions previously established for the dechlorination (5.0 mol% Cp2Zr(OTs)2, 3.0 mol% Ir(4-MeOppy)3, 60 mol% 1,3-di(ptolyl)thiourea, 1,4-CHD (3.0 equiv), PhCF3, MS4Å, blue LEDs, 35 °C, 12 h) did not promote defluorination. This indicates that the defluorination requires a distinct set of conditions compared to dechlorination. However, after further optimization of these parameters, we identified effective reaction conditions for this transformation. Additional screening of photocatalysts and solvents also influenced the yield of 2a (see the Supporting Information for details). Control experiments in the absence of photocatalyst, zirconocene, or visible light irradiation resulted in no product (entries 8-10), highlighting the essential role of each component and the necessity of visible light. With the optimized reaction conditions, in hand, we next explored the substrate scope (Table ). Various afluoroacetic acid derivatives, including alkyl ester (1a), benzyl esters (1b-1e), benzyl amide (1f), and anilides (1g and 1h), were successfully defluorinated, affording to the corresponding hydrogenated products 2a-2h in moderate to good yields. Interestingly, the starting material to anilide 2g, monofluoromethyl compound 1g, is the product of a SET-based photoredox reaction that typically targets trifluoromethylated compounds. This observation highlights the complementary nature of the newly developed reaction compared to SET-based photoredox processes. Notably, defluorination occurred preferentially over the dehalogenation of bromoarenes (E1/2 = -2.2 V vs SCE) or chloroarenes (E1/2 = -2.6 V vs SCE), which are more susceptible to single-electron reduction. Additionally, benzyl fluoride (1i) and difluoroacetamide (1j), which possess weaker (97.6 kcal/mol) and similarly strong C-F bonds, respectively, compared to monofluoroacetate, were also successfully defluorinated. Secondary alkyl fluorides, including easily reducible substrates such as ketone (1k) and trifluoromethyl arene (1l), were To further explore the synthetic potential of this reaction, we then investigated the radical alkylation of monofluorides (Table ). After screening various conditions, we found that the combination of Ir(4t Buppy)3, ( n BuC5H4)2ZrCl2, TU1, and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (1,4-CHD), under visible light irradiation efficiently converted 1b and alkene 3 into the desired alkylated products 4. Gratifyingly, various terminal olefins containing different functional groups, such as alkyl (3a and 3b), silyl (3c), boronate (3d), and nitrile (3e) were all tolerated, yielding the corresponding alkylated products 4ba-4be in moderate to good yields. Additionally, the thioglycoside derivative (3f), aryl benzoate (3g), and benzamide (3h) react well without affecting these reactive functional groups. Notably, even an internal alkene (3i) was successfully alkylated. Furthermore, activated alkenes such as enol ethers (3j and 3k), enamine (3l), vinyl sulfide (3m), and indene (3n) afforded the corresponding alkylated products 4bi-4bn in moderate to good yields. Interestingly, when diphenyl ethylene (3o) was employed, unsaturated ester 4bo was obtained, likely via an oxidative radical-polar crossover followed by deprotonation. Furthermore, natural products and pharmaceutical compound, including safrole (3p), eugenol (3q), and alibendol (3r), were successfully applied in this transformation. Next, we examined the scope of fluorides using terminal alkene 3s. a-Fluoroacetates (1a and 1c) were applicable to yield the corresponding alkylated products 4as and 4cs in moderate yields. Amide (1f) and anilides (1g and 1h) were also tolerated under these conditions. Moreover, malonate (1n) was successfully alkylated, providing product 4ns. These results demonstrate the mild conditions of our catalytic system, which enables defluorinative alkylation to proceed efficiently with a broad range of functional groups, highlighting the versatility and unique radical reactivity of this methodology.",

  "To showcase the synthetic potential of drimenol ( ) and albicanol ( ) as chiral building blocks, we aimed to synthesize several DMTs, including zonarol (1), ent-(+)-chromazonarol (2), mycoleptodiscin A (3), and pelorol ( ), with different aryl-ring modes for divergent synthesis. The synthesis commenced with iodination of these two chiral compounds under Appel's conditions, resulting in the corresponding alkyl iodide on gram scale. In the initial attempts of nickel-catalyzed reductive cross-coupling between drimenyl iodide (S4) and aryl iodide (S5), diene (S6) was the dominant product due to β-H elimination (Table ). Fortunately, alkyl iodide (7) obtained from albicanol successfully produced coupled products 9 in moderate to good yields with various aryl halides using Weix's condition (Figure ). From these intermediates, we developed concise routes to produce the target DMTs. Zonarol (1) was obtained via selective debenzylation of 9a using Li/naphthalene (Table ). Subsequent BF 3 •Et 2 Omediated cyclization yielded 2 in 4 steps with 65% overall yield from albicanol (Table ). A SnCl 4induced Friedel-Crafts cyclization/reductive deprotection sequence of 9b afforded 3 in 51% yield over 2 steps. Then, Dethe's method involved demethylation following oxidation enabled a 6-step total synthesis of 3, shortening the previous route by 8 steps (Table ).

  "WT binds to LA with a KD value of 2.2 ± 1.1 μM (Figure , left, and 4C). In contrast, after dhG modification, FABP5 WT displayed ca. 3-fold higher binding affinity (KD = 0.74 ± 0.05 μM) (Figure , right, and 4C), consistent with the observation that FABP5 Sglutathionylation increases its binding with LA. However, after GSSG incubation, FABP5 WT displayed binding affinity (KD = 2.4 ± 6.1 μM) similar to non-glutathionylated FABP5 WT (Figure and). The discrepancy was hypothesized that FABP5 WT Sglutathionylation at C127 may have caused C120 to displace the glutathione on C127, forming an intramolecular disulfide during purification steps. To remove the complication resulting from C120/C127 disulfide, we analyzed FABP5 C120S. FABP5 C120S retained similar binding affinity (KD = 2.3 ± 2.1 μM) (Figure , left, and 4C) comparable to FABP5 WT, suggesting C120S mutation does not cause a significant change in its binding to LA.",
  "Considering 3-cation oxides, 535 of the 28612 compositions in the training set meet these criteria, comprising 47 3-cation composition spaces. In the prediction space, 602 compositions are predicted to meet these criteria, comprising 144 3-cation spaces not in the training set. Naturally, some of these 3-cation spaces will be predicted to meet the criteria because a 2-cation composition in the training data meets the criteria and the model predicts that adding 10% of an additional cation does not alter the absorption spectrum significantly enough to fail the criteria. The more notable predictions are thus the 3-cation spaces predicted to have a composition meeting the criteria even though none of the 2-cation subspaces in the training data meet the criteria.

  "With the simple and gentle optimized conditions established, we proceeded to evaluate the scope of the deconstructive chlorination process. Not only for chlorides, this reaction is also applied to produce bromides and iodides via changing halide sources. Many compounds with important functional groups were suitable sources for alcohol substrates. As shown in Fig. , linear (1-47) and cyclic alcohols (48-67) all reacted successfully, giving the corresponding alkyl halides in synthetically useful to excellent yields. To investigate the structural diversity of substrates, commercially available (1-6) or readily prepared primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols, which were generated easily from aldehydes (7, 8), ketones (9-16), and esters (17-47), were all explored. With formaldehyde (1-4, 17), acetone (5, 6, 12, 13, 18-47), benzaldehyde (7), acetaldehyde (8), or acetophenone (9-11, 14-16) as the leaving fragment, the reaction presented diverse primary, secondary, and tertiary carbon radicals to yield various alkyl halides. As coupling fragments with halides, heterocycle, ring-structured alkyl, benzyl, alkenyl, linear alkyl with or without arene replacements, and alkyl with or without heteroatoms were all tolerated. Delightfully, homobenzylic halides with different phenyl substitutes could be produced in moderate to good isolated yields from different sources (4-6, 14-16, 18-22). Electronic effects on benzene rings didn't show much impact on the process. A similar observation was found for benzylic radical fragments (1-3, 17). It is notable that even when active benzylic/allylic sites were accessible, no regioisomer was found besides the desired product (3-6, 8, 14-23, 27).",

  "UU-201 showed the highest SF6 uptake at 1 bar, 293K, of ~4.00 mmol g -1 (~110 cm 3 cm -3 ), followed by UU-202 with ~3.28 mmol g -1 (~86.5 cm 3 cm -3 ), UU-203 with ~2.99 mmol g -1 (~31.2 cm 3 cm -3 ) and UU-204 with ~2.75 mmol g -1 (~56.2 cm 3 cm -3 ). The SF6 working capacities of the UU-MOFs could be represented by considering the gas uptakes at 0.1 and 1.0 bar, these values are listed in Table . The SF6 uptake off these four MOFs can be compared with a number of other microporous sorbents in Table , The mmol g -1 SF6 uptake of the UU-201 is comparable to those of Zn-MOF-74 (3.80 mmol g -1 at 298 K and 1 bar) , Co2-(1,4-bdc)2(dabco) (3.39 mmol g -1 at 298 K and 1 bar) , Zn4O(btb)2 (3.12 mmol g -1 at 298 K and 1 bar) , and MIL-100(Fe) (2.95 mmol g -1 at 298 K and 1 bar) . As the SF6 capacity of UU-201 is high, we also consider the vol./vol. gas uptake that could be relevant for real-life applications. The vol./vol. uptake of UU-201 (Table ), although not as high as Mg-MOF-74 (~158 cm 3 cm -3 at 1 bar), is higher than most other commonly discussed potential SF6 sorbents, such as Zn-MOF-74, Co-MOF-74, Co2(1,4-bdc)2(dabco), UiO-66(Zr), and zeolite 13X etc. The difference between the SF6 uptake on UU-201 and UU-202 was ~21 mol.% g -1 and between UU-203 and UU-204 was ~8 mol.% g -1 (higher than the expect 6 mol.% g -1 based on the difference in the metal alone). It was clear that the UU-201 and UU-202 structure had a higher overall SF6 uptake capacity than UU-203 and UU-204, although the SF6 uptake at low pressures was higher on UU-203 and UU-204. These observations could be explained with the following: 1) All four MOFs have pores with apertures ~7-9 Å, pores in this size-range were previously observed by us on mixed-linker ZIF-7-8 to be favorable for SF6 sorption. 2) The overall pore volume related to pores in the favorable size-range may be higher on UU-201 and UU-202 than on UU-203 and UU-204, which would explain the increased SF6 capacity on UU-201 and UU-202, 3) The pores on UU-203 and UU-204 may be overall smaller than those on UU-201 and UU-202, possibly arising from the size-difference between the TBAPy 4--and TCPB 4--linkers. These smaller pores (~7 Å, Figure , e.g. lozenge-shaped channels) are closer in size to the kinetic diameter of SF6 and have enhanced interaction with SF6 compared to the larger pores found on UU-201 and UU-202 (DFT-PSD peak at around 8.7-9 Å, i.e. hexagonal channels). This is apparent according to the SF6 adsorption isotherms of UU-203 and UU-204, where the isotherms showed a shape increase at the low-pressure range. a Measured at 293 K.",

  "We further sought to exploit the ability of intercepting the diradicaloid o-QDMs by H-atom transfer (HAT) to synthesize tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloids and related bioactive molecules directly from simply arylaldimines (Table ).

Our initial attempt to synthesize ticlopidine (Ticlid®) 21, a commercial medicine to prevent strokes, from an imine derived from 2-vinylthiophene-3-carbaldehyde and 2chlorobenzylamine led to benzylic thioetherification potentially due to reaction at the benzylic position with 4-FC6H4S•. We were able to address this issue and synthesize ticlopidine 21 by simply switching 4-FC6H4SH to its sterically encumbered variant, 2,4,6-triisopropylthiophenol, to prevent the radical recombination with ArS•. Moreover, we also utilized imines derived from 2-vinyl-4,5-dimethoxybenzaldimine with 3,4-dimethoxybenzylamine, 3,4-methylenedioxybenzylamine and 4-fluorobenzylamine, respectively, to prepare intebremine 22, intebrinine 23 and MAO-B-In-15 (a MAO-B inhibitor) 24. 25b, 29 Likewise, we were also able to convert an imine derived from 2-vinyl-4,5methylenedioxyphenylcarbaldehyde with 4-methoxybenzylamine to another alkaloid viguine 25.

The reaction can be conducted in toluene, DCE, MeOH and DMF in similar yields (69-82%) (entries 2-4). The reaction proceeded in moderate yields (38-43%) in other solvents like MeCN, DMA, NMP and DMSO (entry 5). The reaction could also be run without solvent (neat), at 100 °C, in 1 h or with 1 equiv of N-phenylphthalimide to obtain the product in good yields (entries 6-9). After establishing the optimal reaction parameters, we examined the scope of o-QDMs for [4 + 2] cycloaddition (Table ). The azacyclic o-QDMs could be intercepted with a range of cyclic dienophiles, such as maleic anhydride, maleimide, N-alkyl (methyl, t-butyl, cyclohexyl) maleimide and N-aryl maleimide (27-32) in high endo selectivity. The azacyclic o-QDMs also tolerate acidic protons as shown by the [4 + 2] cycloaddition with N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)maleimide (32). The o-QDMs were also reactive with acyclic symmetric dienophiles like trans-1,2-dibenzoylethylene (33). Unsymmetric dienophiles such as methyl vinyl ketone and methyl acrylate furnished the [4 + 2] cycloaddition products (34-35) as a mixture of endo and exo products in moderate selectivity. Next, we examined the scope with regard to different electronic and steric variations on 2-alkenylaldimines. The reaction tolerates both electron rich and deficient substituents, such as methyl, tert-butyl, methoxy, dimethoxy, 1,3-dioxanyl, fluoro, difluoro, trifluoromethyl and nitro, at different positions on the aldiminyl arenes (36-48). Likewise, the 2-alkene in 2-alkenylaldimine can also be varied with methyl, phenyl, ester and benzyl ether at the  and -positions (39-55), demonstrating that both disubstituted terminal (49-51) and internal (52-55) alkenes can participate in the reaction. More sterically hindered tri-and tetrasubstituted 2-alkenes bearing two and three methyls, carbocycles and N,O-heterocycles at both the and -positions also undergo 6-electrocyclization followed by [4 +2] cycloaddition (56-61), showcasing the robustness of this method and high reactivity of azacyclic o-QDMs to create highly hindered bridged azabicyclic structures. The reaction also shows a high level of compatibility with substituted anilines on the imine. For example, imines derived from anilines substituted at ortho, meta and para-positions with methyl, methoxy, dimethoxy, thiomethyl, chloro, bromo, iodo and meta-dinitro groups, are excellent substrates for [4 + 2] cycloaddition (62-69). Imines derived from polyaromatic amines (70) and heteroaryl amines (71) are also compatible for the reaction. Reactions can also be conducted with 2-alkenylketimines derived from 2-alkenylacetophenone and 2-alkenylbenzophenone (72-73). Conditions. a Reactions were run with 0.50 mmol imine and 0.75 mmol N-phenylphthalimide in 3.0 mL dioxane at 130 °C for 3 h. Unless stated otherwise, the ratio in parenthesis represent endo:exo. In-situ generated imine (1.0 mmol) was used directly without purification.",

  "Alanine mutants W33A, R35A, Y139A, and Y181A in MaRedAm (Table ) led to noticeable changes in the stereoselectivity of these enzymes. The two neighbouring MaRedAm variants, W33A and R35A, exhibited improvements in e.e. values, yielding, for example, (R)-rasagiline 3b in up to 95% e.e., compared to 74% e.e. achieved by the wild-type enzyme, Table . In contrast, the Y139A mutant led to a marked decrease in e.e. (64% e.e, (R)-4b). Similar trends were observed with these mutants for the synthesis of 4b, with W33A, R35A, Y118A, and Y181A all leading to significant improvement in e.e. of up >97% compared to 63% e.e. achieved by the wild-type enzyme. Again, Y139A led to a considerable decrease in e.e. value (25%). The bulky protic residues Y118, Y139A, and Y181A were also associated with decreased activity and afforded lower conversion values. Remarkably, the MaRedAm mutation, W211A, confers a profound switch in stereoselectivity to form the opposite enantiomer for both transformations (3b, W211A gave 42% e.e. (S) versus 74% e.e. (R) for wild-type; 4b, W211A gave 52% e.e (S) versus 63 % e.e. (R) for wild-type). Biotransformation reactions with purified enzyme preparation for selected variants (wild-type, W35A, W33A and W211A) across three transformations confirmed this pattern of stereoselectivity changes, Supporting Information, Table .",

However, the chemical shifts of the labeled carbon in each Xaa-[1-13 C]Gly-d2-NMe2 probe were found to converge at approximately 170.3 ppm at pH 7.4 (Fig. ).

  "It should be noted that the tensile stress-strain curves of the sensors including S-PUF/V2O5, S-PUF/V2O5/PPy-10, S-PUF/V2O5/PPy-15, and S-PUF/V2O5/PPy-33 displayed two fracture peaks, which are attributed to the different elongations at break of different structural layers in the sensors based on a sandwich structure (Figure , Movies S1-S4, Supporting Information). The anode material was broken first, followed by the cathode material and the PAM gel upon stretching. The elongations at break for S-PUF/V2O5, S-PUF/V2O5/PPy-10, S-PUF/V2O5/PPy-15, and S-PUF/V2O5/PPy-33 are approximately 56.8%, 56.7%, 57.5%, and 57.8%, respectively.

See Supporting Information for experimental details. deoxygenative hydroalkylation (Table ). Using an alternative Ni-diketonate sorting catalyst, an array of primary substrates were paired with tertiary olefin-derived radicals to efficiently access diverse quaternary products (see SI for additional examples of hydromethylation or hydroalkylation). In these cases, simple hydrocarbon-, ether-or acetal-containing alcohols were broadly successful (24-30, 52-68% yield), as were substrates bearing tetrahydropyran (31 and 32, 73% and 55% yield, respectively), morpholine (33, 52% yield), lactam (34, 63% yield) or pyridine (35, 60% yield) heterocyclic functionality. Moreover, the functional group tolerance of this method allowed for retention of protic motifs such as amine derivatives or unprotected distal alcohols (36-40, 51-89% yield). The latter finding is particularly significant when considering the selectivity of NHC-mediated deoxygenation for activating less-substituted sites within diol substrates. As such, this protocol could enable the stepwise and site-selective elaboration of native polyols into complex scaffolds using olefin feedstock partners. Lastly, to rapidly produce drug-like, C(sp 3 )-rich molecular architecture from native functionality, we harnessed olefinalcohol coupling for the late-stage derivatization of medicinally-relevant scaffolds (Figure ). Using methanol, hydromethylated products were expediently furnished from bioactive compounds bearing a typically unreactive olefin within their structure, including the antimalarial quinine (41, 34% yield), the antibiotic retapamulin (42, 30% yield), common steroids (43, 70% yield) and the plant-derived stimulant picrotoxinin (44, 47% yield). Delightfully, this reactivity was also extendable to other quaternary carbon formations, as both the aforementioned substrates and a derivative of the muscular dystrophy therapeutic ataluren were efficiently hydroalkylated using diverse primary alcohols (45-48, 43-73% yield). Across all cases, the unique tolerance of this method for labile functionality (including readily-oxidized amines and sulfides, coordinating alcohols and pyridines, or oxidative additionprone 1,2,4-oxadiazoles) was critical for the generation of complex molecular architecture in an efficient manner.",

  "To our delight, the use of AgBF4 and AgSbF6 led to an increase in yield (61% and 66%, respectively) (entry 4-5); whereas, other silver salts like AgNTf2 and AgOTs, bearing strongly coordinating counterion, were found to be almost ineffective for this transformation (entry 6-7). This observation suggests that silver salts with non-coordinating counterion are more efficient for this transformation. Subsequently, various solvents like o-DCB, DCE, MeOH, CHCl3 and 1,4dioxane were screened; amongst which, the use of DCE provided an excellent yield of 98% (entry 9).

All artemisinin-based hybrids 1-7 display superior potency against SARS-CoV-2 (EC 50 values 7.8 -46 μM) outperforming artesunic acid. The most active artesunic acid-derived hybrid 7 (EC 50 = 7.8 µM) is also significantly more potent in vitro than its parent compound artesunic acid (EC 50 >50 µM) and shows low cytotoxic effects on benchmark Vero E6 cells. Notably, also synthetic peroxide-based hybrids 8-13 were remarkably potent against SARS-CoV-2. Most active synthetic peroxide-quinoline hybrid was 10 (EC 50 = 11.5 µM). Among quinoline-based new compounds, quinolineadamantane 15 (EC 50 = 1.5 μM) is the most efficient in vitro, outperforming chloroquine (EC 50 = 3.8 µM) and remdesivir (EC 50 = 4.0 µM), used as reference drugs.

  "Compounds 1, 2 and 3 exhibit red emission in the solid state at room temperature (RT) upon excitation with a UV lamp (Figure .). At RT, the excitation and emission maxima (λexc; λem) are (427 nm; 660 nm), (425 nm; 620 nm) and (440 nm; 650 nm) with Stokes shifts of 8267, 7400 and 7342 cm -1 for 1, 2 and 3, respectively (Figure .). These large Stokes shifts suggest a phosphorescent nature of the process. The photoluminescence properties of 1, 2 and 3 are close to those of the 1D [Cu(SPh)]n, [Cu(o-SPhCO2H)]n and [Cu(o-SPhCO2Me)]n that exhibit intense luminescence with strong peaks centered at 645, 719 and 596 nm, respectively, upon excitation at 359, 412 and 415 nm, respectively. The low energy emission of [Cu(SPh)]n, considering previous studies on Cu(I) thiolates, has been assigned to ligand to metal charge transfer (LMCT). Therefore, the photoluminescence properties of 1, 2 and 3 can originate from LMCT. The luminescence lifetime decay of 1 at RT is fitted by a biexponential curve with components of 10.8 µs (97 %) and 139.6 µs (3 %).

  "In order to obtain melazolide B (5), we undertook an alternative route through enone 17 (Scheme 4). Several ketone dehydrogenation conditions of 11 was first examined. A two-step sequence involving TMS enol ether formation and dehydrogenation was first attempted. Treatment of ketone 11 with KHMDS and TMSCl resulted in 16 in 36% yield (Scheme 4A). Although the original Saegusa-Ito oxidation conditions only led to full decomposition of the sily enol ether starting material ( ), subjection of 16 to Tsuji's modified conditions smoothly delivered the enone product (17) in 91% yield (Scheme 4A). Several one-step dehydrogenation conditions were surveyed (Scheme 4B). Utilizing our laboratory's allyl-Pd-catalyzed dehydrogenation conditions (entries 1-3) resulted in overoxidation (18), however, the Ni-catalyzed dehydrogenation conditions only gave partially recovered starting material (entry 4). Employing either Mukaiyama's reagent (entries 5-6) or IBX (entry 7) resulted in minimal desired product. Subjection of 11 to Stahl's Pd-",
  "Where the subscribe \"𝐹\" represents the Frobenius norm. We next introduced an additional constrain to the above Lagrangian. As the TPM, 𝑇(𝑡), shall satisfy the row-sum rule, i.e., ∑ 𝑇 %* (𝑡) * = 1. To consider this constrain, we utilized the logarithm form of the row-sum rule as derived below: Where 𝜆 ' and 𝑣 ' refer to the first eigenvalue and eigenvector, respectively. In IGME, the input 𝑇(𝑡) (i.e., 𝑇(𝜏 7 ), 𝑇(𝜏 7 + Δ𝑡), … , 𝑇(𝜏 7 + 𝐿)) generated by MSMBuilder already satisfy the row-sum rule. However, predicted TPMs, 𝑇(𝑡 > 𝜏 7 + 𝐿), may not satisfy the row-sum rule if this constraint is not explicitly included in the least-square fitting. In order to guaranteed that all predicted TPMs satisfy the row-sum rule, we need to ensure both 𝐴 and 𝑇 ª satisfy the row-sum rule. However, the row-sum rule",

  "Heterocyclic aldehydes with thiophene and pyridine moieties were both amenable substrates in their reactions with ethyl bromide, 4-bromo-1,1,1-trifluorobutane, and allyl chloride, repectively, producing the corresponding alcohols 17, 16 and 15 in 62-92% yields. The successful preparation of 15 is notable, since 2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde was reported to be unreactive in the mechanochemical Barbier reaction with zinc. Non-enolizable ketones, such as 2,2,2-trifluoroacetophenone and benzophenone, did not require NH4Cl as an essential additive and furnished the respective carbonyl adducts with allyl chloride 18 and 19 in a high yield of 87% and 98%, respectively (Scheme 4, d).

  "After optimizing the reaction conditions, we explored the substrate scope. As shown in Figure , OTs and OTf substituted 4-tert-butylbenzene are effective electrophiles, yielding 52% and 78% of product 8, respectively. Other aryl bromides, including both electron-rich and electron-deficient arenes, were suitable electrophiles for this cross-coupling reaction (9 to 19). The aryl bromides with electron-rich substituents (8 to 14) delivered slightly higher yields (49% to 72%) compared to those with electron-deficient substituents (15 to 19, with yields ranging from 42% to 66%). This may be due to the low reactivity of electron-rich aryl bromides in the oxidative addition reaction with the Ni I intermediate, which slows down the competing homo-coupling reaction of aryl bromides. The aryl bromide electrophiles with various functional groups, including methoxy group (11 and 12), ester (15), fluoride (16), ketone (18), and trifluoromethyl group (19), as well as protection groups such as amide (13), acetal (14), and tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) (20 and 21), were found to be effective in this reaction. The para-substituted methoxy bromobenzene delivered a yield comparable to that of the meta-substituted methoxy bromobenzene (52% yield for 11 and 49% yield for 12). While the C(sp 3 )-C(sp 2 ) cross-coupling product was not obtained when using ortho-substituted methoxy bromobenzene electrophile. When the aryl halide contains F, Cl, and Br, the C-Br bond is selectively functionalized. Yields of 54% and 61% were obtained for products 16 and 17, respectively, from 1-bromo-4-fluorobenzene and 1-bromo-4-chlorobenzene. For substrates with strong electron-withdrawing substituents such as methoxycarbonyl (15) and acetyl (18) groups, and π-conjugation extended aryl groups (22), the use of the 2,2'-bpy ligand resulted in the most favorable results (with yields of 66%, 42%, and 51% for 15, 18, and 22, respectively).",

  "Conversely, conjugated alkenes (2-E/Z, 8-13) demonstrated improved performance, with errors as low as 1.5 kcal/mol for indene (9). However, notable errors persisted, with E-b-methyl styrene (10) and Z-b-methyl styrene ( ) displaying errors of 6.1 and 14.3 kcal/mol, respectively. Similarly, Z-stilbene (2-Z) and styrene (8) also performed very poorly, with errors of 11.7 and 5.9 kcal/mol, respectively. Dienes such as isoprene ( ) also gave an error of 6.0 kcal/mol.

  "With conditions in hand for iodo-and bromosulfonylation of 1, the scope of the reaction was studied (Figure ). Aryl sulfinates bearing neutral or electron-donating substituents(2a-2c) gave the corresponding sulfone BCP iodides and bromides 3a-3c in near quantitative yields (96-100%, up to ~2 g scale). Halogenated arenes were well-tolerated, particularly for BCP bromide synthesis (3d-3f, 50-100%). Good to excellent yields were also observed for electron-deficient aryl sulfonyl bromides 3g-Br-3i-Br (for example, the p-CF3 aryl sulfone 3i-Br was obtained in 97% yield from the isolated sulfonyl bromide intermediate on 0.7 g scale, or in 61% yield using a one-pot procedure); however the corresponding iodides performed less well, and typically benefited from cooling to -40 °C to limit competing desulfonylation. Sterically-encumbered o-tolyl and mesityl sulfinates proceeded smoothly, giving BCP iodide 3j-I in 88% yield, and mesityl adducts 3k-I and 3k- Br in 66% and 82% yield respectively. A lower yield of 3j-Br was observed (33%) due to competing benzylic bromination of the methyl group. Additional m-electron-withdrawing substituents were also accommodated, with 3,5-di-F and 3,5-di-CF3 arenes affording sulfonyl BCP halides 3l and 3m in 58-100% yield. The inferior reactivity observed with acetamide 2n was surprising, even on cooling to -40 °C, possibly due to competing reaction at the amide. A bis-arylsulfinate could even be used successfully to deliver bis-sulfonyl BCP iodide 3o-I and bromide 3o-Br in 26% and 92% yield respectively. [3.1.1]Propellane 4 is emerging as a convenient reagent to access novel m-substituted arene bioisosteres; 12 pleasingly, the addition of sulfonyl halides translated smoothly to this propellane, giving sulfonyl BCHep halide products in excellent yields (5a-I, 87% and 5a-Br, 100%).",

While the proportion of small colloids increased with stagnation time (24HS) for OrthoP (71.1% of Pb0.45µm) and TrimetaP (50.8% of Pb0.45µm) treatment, it was similar with TripolyP and decreased with HexametaP (0.9% of Pb0.45 µm). Lead colloids dispersed by HexametaP at the 30-min HRT appeared to dissolve over the extended stagnation (24HS), based on the large decrease in the colloidal fraction with increasing reaction time.",

  "In order to investigate the anti-leukemia activity of novel quinazolinethiohydantoin fused heterocycles, we employed some selected examples of the synthesized quinazoline-thiohydantoin fused heterocycles against sensitive wild-type CCRF-CEM and multidrugresistant P glycoprotein-overexpressing CEM/ADR5000 cells (Table ). Interestingly, while investigated achiral compounds 3a, 3j-3l and 3n-3p showed no significant activity against the CCRF-CEM and CEM/ADR5000 cell lines, all chiral enantiopure heterocycles 5a-5c, 5f, 5g, 5j, 5k, 5n-5w (except 5u) showed high anti-leukemia effect (Table ).

To estimate the selectivity of our novel quinazoline-thiohydantoin-fused heterocycles, we have investigated them also against healthy human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Remarkably, all tested compounds were significantly less active against healthy human PBMCs, than against sensitive and multi-drug-resistant leukemia cells. The range of IC50 values in PBMCs was between 1.5±0.02 μM and >100 μM.",

  "With the optimal reaction conditions in hands, we further explored the substrate scope of this reaction using 1-tetralones 4 (Scheme 2). In addition to 3Aa, this reaction allowed to synthesize 7-methoxy substituted compound 3Ba in 59% yield with good regioselectivity. Fluorine-substituted 3Ca was also generated in a moderate yield and maintained good regioselectivity. 5-Benzyloxydihydronaphthalen-2-yl benzoxazole 3Da was synthesized with a 53% yield. These results indicated that electronic and positional variations on the aromatic ring on tetralone 4 did not significantly affect this reaction progress. We then assessed of this reaction with various benzoxazoles. Both 5-phenyl-and 5-alkyl-substituted benzoxazoles underwent this reaction, giving the corresponding enloate dance/coupling products in moderate yields (3Ab, 3Ac, and 3Ad). Furthermore, 4-methoxybenzoxazole was incorporated at the C2 position, furnishing 3Ae in 58% yield with moderate regioselectivity. Notably, the potentially competitive 4-pivaloxy substituted benzoxazole 2f reacted smoothly under the present conditions, resulting in 3Af with a 61% yield and moderate regioselectivity. This finding demonstrates that the in-situ generated alkenyl pivalate exhibits higher reactivity toward Ni/dcype catalyst than the aryl-OPiv moiety. Unfortunately, other 1,3-azoles such as oxazole, benzothiazoles, and benzimidazoles were not applicable to these reaction conditions, leading to poor yields of products or no reaction (See the SI for details).

This is unsurprising given that stable L2Ni 0 and L2Ni II complexes can readily form with PCy3. Nonetheless, the ability to synthesize [(PCy3)Ni I Br]2 differs from the ligand structure-speciation trends observed in generation of the analogous Pd I dimers. Like CyP(t-Bu)2 and Cy2P(t-Bu), the L2Ni I Br monomer (13 (L = PCy3)) was readily obtained with PCy3.",

Electron-rich 5-membered heterocyclic sulfinates performed best, such as thiophene 2p and 2-bromothiophene 2q, with yields ranging from 82-99% for both the iodide and bromide products. The thiophene sulfonyl BCP bromides could be prepared on 2.5 g scale from the isolated sulfonyl bromides with equally impressive 98% yields for both substrates. 3-Pyrazole sulfinate 2r was similarly successful, giving the BCP iodide and bromide 3r-I/Br in 92% and 100% yields, respectively, whereas 2-pyrazole sulfinate gave a poor yield of the bromide 3s-Br (15%). 3-Furyl sulfonyl BCP bromide 3t-Br was achieved in 53% yield using PPh3•Br2 complex to prepare the sulfonyl bromide in situ. Substrates containing N-nucleophilic sites proved challenging, presumably due to competing reactivity with the sulfonyl halide: 13 oxazole 2u gave a low yield of the BCP iodide 3u-I (19%) but a 67% yield of the bromide 3u-Br.

  "). PSDs calculated from the CO2 isotherms via the Horvath-Kawazoe (HK) model underline that agZIF-8-mim0.15im0.74bim0.11 also features a considerable amount of smaller micropores with a diameter of 5-6 Å, which are not present in the crystalline ZIF-8-mim0.15im0.74bim0.11 (Figure ).

  "With the optimized conditions in hand, we began to evaluate the reaction scope using unactivated alkenes of different substitution patterns (Table ). In the presence of 3a and electrophilic alkyl iodides 2ad, dialkylation proceeded smoothly to furnish the desired products 4a4ao bearing tertiary or quaternary carbon centers in excellent chemoselectivity with up to 92% yield and >20:1 regioisomeric ratios (r.r.). Terminal alkenes containing a vast array of common acidic and basic functional groups such as ester (4b, 4m, 4q, 4s, 4vx), alkyl bromide (4e), alkyl tosylate (4f), alkyl iodide (4m), (hetero)aryl halide (4v, 4x), amide (4g), silane (4h), phosphine oxide (4i), phthalimide (4j), epoxide (4k), carbonate (4l), acetal (4o), alkyne (4r), silyl ether (4t) and heterocycles (4n, 4p, 4u, 4wy) are well-tolerated in our system. Remarkably, sp 3and sp 2 -hybridized organohalides (4e, 4f, 4m, 4v, 4x) which are typically prone to reaction with low-valent nickel species 17 did not interfere with dialkylation, providing complementarity to established catalytic regimes (see Scheme 1) and facilitating access to molecules with useful halogen handles for downstream functionalizations. 18 3a (2.0 equiv) PhCF 3 ( Sterically demanding internal alkenes which sometimes pose reactivity challenges in Ni catalysis 12f also served as effective substrates for SH2-enabled alkene cross-coupling. Cyclic and acyclic 1,2-disubstituted (4z, 4ad), trisubstituted (4aa, 4ab) and even tetrasubstituted (4ac) C=C bonds are amenable to dialkylation, although regioand diastereochemical control prove difficult in some cases. To further showcase functional group compatibility, we extended the catalytic dialkylation manifold to the late-stage functionalization of alkenes embedded within or appended to multifunctional bioactive compounds. Gratifyingly, dialkylated products 4ae4am were secured in good yields and site selectivities, highlighting the robustness of our transformation towards the construction of complex C(sp 3 )-rich architectures at advanced stages of synthetic processes. The reactions affording 4agai and 4ak took place selectively at the sterically less hindered C=C bond. It merits mention that there was no competitive addition of the intermediate open-shell species to the electron-deficient -bonds of -unsaturated carbonyl units in 4agai, underscoring the remarkable chemoselectivity. Notably, when dialkylation was executed on alkenes with neighboring strained four-membered rings such as natural products α-pinene and caryophyllene oxide, ring-opening was observed to give 4an and 4ao, respectively. These results suggest the plausible intermediacy of cyclobutylcarbinyl radicals generated by initial addition of the iodoalkane-derived electrophilic radical, which are susceptible to ring cleavage before the second C(sp 3 )-C(sp 3 ) bond-forming event.",

For inhibitory activity, 9 representative tyrosine kinases, including EGFR family kinases, were selected: EGFR, ERBB2, abelson tyrosine-protein kinase (ABL), proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase (SRC), lymphocyte-specific tyrosine-protein kinase (LCK), platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRβ), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), and ephrin type-B receptor 4 (EPHB4). The selection procedure was as follows. First, bioactivity information about EGFR, which was also analyzed in a previous study, was collected.",
  "To examine the inhibitory effect of 37 phytochemicals on M pro (MBP-tagged M pro ), Dabcyl-KTSAVLQSGFRKME-Edans was used as a substrate, and the formed cleaved peptide (SGFRKME-Edans) was then estimated using an HPLC fluorescence At 20 µM, several phytochemicals had a considerable suppressive effect on the protease activity of the enzyme (0.5 µM) (Fig. ). The IC50s for the phytochemicals were estimated as EGCG (0.4 µM), myricetin (0.9 µM), theaflavin (6. ). Under the conditions, IC50s of the positive controls, ebselen and GC376, were 0.4 and 18.8 µM, respectively.

  "Control experiments showed that the choice of sulfone donor, the reducing ability of the photocatalyst, Cu(I) catalyst, BTMG base, and photoirradiation were critical to achieving high efficiency for the N-glycosylation. Reduction potential measurements vs. SCE in CH3CN indicated that the BthSO2 donor 6 (E1/2 red = -1.48V) is considerably more reducible than 2-pyridyl sulfone 4 (E1/2 red = -1.82V) and phenyl sulfone 5 (E1/2 red = -1.70V). Neither 4 nor 5 can react with 2 to give 3 under our standard conditions. The reduction potential of PC1 ((E1/2 red [Ir III /Ir II ] = -1.51 V) matches well with sulfone donor 6. PC2 fac-Ir(ppy)3 (E1/2 red [Ir III /Ir II ] = -2.19 V) is slightly less effective but also worked well (entry 12). The addition of photocatalysts like [Ir(dtbbpy)(dFppy)2]PF6 (PC3), [Ir(dF(CF3)ppy)2 dtbbpy]PF6 (PC4), Ru(bpy)3Cl2 (PC5), or eosin Y (PC6) gave lower yields of 3 than the standalone Cu catalysis (entries 13-16 vs. 3). The combination of PC2 and chloride donor 1 did not furnish any product 3 under various conditions, indicating the importance of a delicate interplay between the Cu-mediated and photocatalystmediated pathways. No conversion of 6 took place in the absence of LED irradiation (entry 7). Irradiation with green LED gave a slightly lower yield of 3 than blue LED (entry 20). A sufficiently strong base was necessary for high efficiency. Both BTMG (pKa = 23.6 in MeCN) and 1,8-diazabicyclo(5.4.0)undec-7-ene (DBU, pKa = 24.3 in MeCN) could promote this reaction, but DBU exhibited lower reactivity (entry 17). Product 3 was formed in <5% yield when Et3N or K2CO3 was used as the base (entries 18, 19). Other Cu catalysts could also work but were not as effective as Cu(MeCN)4PF6 (See Supplementary Table ). The use of dtbbpy ligand boosted the yield but was not essential (entries 10 vs. 1 and Supplementary Table ). The reaction worked best in halogenated hydrocarbon solvents. CH3CN and THF provided little amounts of the desired product (entry 21 and Supplementary Table & S5). The performance of the reaction diminished under air atmosphere (entry 23). Interestingly, water was well-tolerated, and the reaction in the biphasic medium of DCM and H2O (v/v = 1:1) gave similar results (~83% yield of 3, entry 22).

  "Here we show another approach to tuning the microporosity in the amorphous solids of MOPs by systematically changing the composition of two mixed ligands in a series of MOPs. We chose an octahedral-type MOP because of its simpler geometry and fewer numbers of components than the prototypical cuboctahedral MOP. We newly synthesized two octahedral Rh(II)-based MOPs with 9H-carbazole dicarboxylate derivatives: [Rh12(HCz)12] (HCzRhMOP) and [Rh12(BnCz)12] (BnCzRhMOP), HCz = 9H-carbazole-3,6-dicarboxylate and BnCz = 9-benzyl-9H-carbazole-3,6-dicarboxylate. To tune the interaction between the MOPs, we further synthesized mixed-ligand H/BnCzRhMOPs of [Rh12(HCz)12-x(BnCz)x] in various ratios of HCz and BnCz (x = 1, 3, 6, 9 and 11 for HCz/BnCz = 11/1, 9/3, 6/6, 3/9 and 1/11, respectively). HCzRhMOP, H/BnCzRhMOPs and BnCzRhMOP showed the linear correlation of their porosity with the number of the benzyl groups. These results indicate that the systematic variation of MOP compositions highly influences the packing arrangement of MOPs and the resulting microporosities (Fig. ). HCzRhMOP and BnCzRhMOP were synthesized by the reactions of [Rh2(acetate)4(methanol)2] with either H2HCz for HCzRhMOP or H2BnCz for BnCzRhMOP in N,N-dimethyl acetamide (DMA) heated at 120°C. The diamagnetic nature of Rh2 paddlewheels allows us to monitor the reaction of the synthesis of HCzRhMOP by 1 H NMR spectroscopy and to optimize the reaction time to be 24 h (Fig. ). BnCzRhMOP was synthesized in 6 h according to the monitoring of the synthetic reaction of BnCzRhMOP (Fig. ).",

  "Cu(II)-mediated C-H bond cleavage to obtain planar phospha [6]dication from P2-OMe leads to an unexpected stable diradical mixture (t1/2>10 days) which can be verified by a broad and pseudo-split ESR signal with a g value of 2.004 (Figure ). In addition, the mixture has an NIR absorption up to 1100 nm, as shown in Figure . According to the reaction path (Figures ), the cyclized radical product [PDC2-OMe] 2•4+ [(OTf)4] 4+ and the oxidative radical product [P2O-OMe] 2•2+ [(OTf)2] 2+ could be responsible for the multiple radical characters. In fact, this Cu(II)-mediated annulation processes a short lifetime radical mechanism, and the trace could be found by means of the UV-vis-NIR monitor. For example, the addition of excess Cu(OTf)2 leads to two new longwavelength absorption bands up to 1500 nm (Figure ). Nevertheless, the separation and purification of radical [PDC2-OMe] 2•4+ [(OTf)4] and nonradical [PDC3] 2+ [(OTf)2] 2-are unprocurable due to poor solubility. Contrastively, the P1 ligand suffers exclusively radicalization on the BINAP core to produce [PDC3] 2+ [(OTf)2] 2-with the planar topology.

  "1-Sm, 1-Gd, and 1-Cm possess M-N distances of 2.626(3) Å, 2.592(3) Å, and 2.5962( ) Å, respectively. Surprisingly, the M-N distance observed in 1-Cm is within error of the 4f congener, 1-Gd, but is substantially shorter than its ionic radii-based analogue, 1-Sm. The M-N distance presented in 1-Sm is slightly shorter than that of a similar molecule, Cp3Sm(py) (py = pyridine), 2.656(3) Å. A longer distance would be anticipated in 1-Sm based on the provided steric bulk from the trimethylsilyl groups of Cp′ competing with 4,4′-bpy. However, 1-Gd exhibits a notable longer Gd-N distance in comparison to that reported in Cp3Gd(NH3), 2.501(6) Å, due to the significantly smaller size of the coordinated NH3. As there has been no single-crystal structural characterization of organometallic curium to date, comparison to similar coordination environments proves challenging. The Cm-N distance of 1-Cm is greater than those reported in Cm(HDPA)3•H2O (H2DPA = 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid) but less than Cm(S2CNEt2)3(N2C12H8). The average Cm-N distance of Cm(HDPA)3 is 2.541(4) Å Scheme 1. Addition of 4,4′-bpy to two equivalents of Cp′3M (M = Sm, Gd, Cm) yields (Cp′3M)2(μ-4,4′-bpy). and 2.550(4) Å for the Λ and Δ enantiomers, respectively, and the reported Cm-N distance Cm(S2CNEt2)3(N2C12H8) is 2.601(6) Å. Curium sets a trend for these bridged organometallic actinide systems in the trivalent state. Previously reported values of isostructural systems containing uranium and americium possess notably longer M-N bonds than 1-Cm: 2.626(7) Å, 2.618(2) Å, and 2.5962 (16) Å respectively, introducing a trend of decreasing M-N distances across the actinide series. This trend excludes thorium owing to its low stability in the trivalent state, resulting in the reduction of 4,4′-bpy and oxidation to Th 4+ . The M-Cent (Cent = Centroid) bond distances observed in 1-Sm, 1-Gd, and 1-Cm are 2.516(3) Å, 2.498(4) Å, and 2.517(3) Å, respectively. Distorted symmetry and steric competition resulting from the increased coordination number causes a deviation in M-Cent distances compared to their Cp′3M counterparts (Table ). A range of M-Cent distances from 2.498(2) Å to 2.538(2) Å is seen in 1-Cm, 2.496(3) Å to 2.537(3) Å in 1-Sm, and 2.477(4) Å to 2.523(4) Å in 1-Gd, presenting a statistically significant variation of about 0.04 Å in all three molecules. A decrease in M-Centavg is observed in comparison to isostructural uranium and americium systems. The average M-Cent length and range observed in 1-Gd are longer and spread over a broader range compared to the reported M-Cent distance range seen in Cp′3Gd, 2.434 Å -2.441 Å owing to increased coordination. Similarly, the Cent-M-Cent angles of 1-Sm, 1-Gd, and 1-Cm are lower than the reported Cent-M-Cent angles of Cp′3M (M = lanthanide), due to the effect of 4,4′-bpy on the coordination environment. The observed average Cent-M-Cent angle in 1-Cm is 117.3°. The Cent-M-N angles of 1-Cm range from 93.761° to 103.628°. This considerable difference can be attributed to the bulkiness of the trimethylsilyl groups of Cp′. Additionally, 4,4′-bpy is angled downward at just over 9°, that is likely due to an interaction between hydrogen from the trimethylsilyl groups and nitrogen on the bridge.",
  "As a second application of successive elongation, we conducted the synthesis of a polycyclopropane (Scheme 5). 22 Some natural products, such as Jawsamycin (FR-900848) 23 and U106305, 24 contain a polycyclopropane structure.

  "High molecular weight (η inh >0.50 dL g -1 ) random copolymers 11 to 15, containing sulfonatable 2,8-dioxydibenzofuran units (Chart 3), were synthesised by nucleophilic aromatic polycondensation of the activated difluoro-monomers 3 to 6 (Chart 1) with various combinations of the bisphenols 2,8-dihydroxydibenzofuran (1) and 4,4'-dihydroxybenzophenone (2) in diphenylsulfone as solvent, using potassium carbonate as the base, at 320 °C. The relative proportions of 'non-sulfonatable' monomer 2 and 'sulfonatable' monomer 1 in these copolymers (Table ) would, after sulfonation, go on to define the equivalent weights and ion-exchange capacities of the final ionomers.

  "Probes 3, 4 and 5 carrying modified variants of the dsRVF-type VSD exhibited improved voltage sensitivity, all in the range of 16.7-18.0% F/F per 100 mV compared to PEG-supported dsRVF5 probe 2 (P < 0.0001, two-tailed unpaired t-test; Figure , Table ). Despite the similar F/F per 100 mV for probes 3-5, probe 3 containing the brightest, azetidine substituted and non-methoxylated dsRVF4 VSD provided voltage-dependent fluorescence with the highest SNR of 7.8, a 2.6-fold increase compared to the less bright reference dsRVF5-containing probe 2 (SNR = 3.0). Also probe 5 (SNR = 5.5), containing both πwire methoxylation and azetidine-substitution of the xanthene core [dsRVF4(OMe)], proved superior to the dsRVF5(OMe)-containing probe 4 (SNR = 3.9), highlighting the importance of increased brightness originating from the azetidine-substituted chromophore. Nevertheless, the effective sensitivity of probe 5 remained lower than that of probe 3, which lacks a methoxy substituent on the π-wire.",

  "In modeling the coalescence of Cu3O4 into larger clusters (T-Cu2O), we evaluated the attachment dynamics of a moving Cu3O4 to a static dormant Cu3O4, comparing perpendicular and parallel orientations. The energetically and kinetically superior perpendicular attachment mechanism (Eads = +0.05 eV, Ediff = +0.61 eV; Figs. ) contrasts with the less favored parallel attachment (Eads = +0.42 eV, Ediff = +0.99 eV; Fig. ). This model necessitates O atom detachment to finalize the coalescence into stoichiometric hexagonal overlayers. Interestingly, diffusion of excess O, that results in O detachment, demonstrates a preference for a parallel path (ΔEads = -0.9 eV; Figs. ), as opposed to an unfavorable perpendicular diffusion (ΔEads = +0.05 eV; Fig. ).",

  "The molecular formula for 12 (C22H37NO4) indicated incorporating an additional C2H6 while also containing one degree of unsaturation less than 11. Based on the GCMS analysis, 12 lacked the olefin between C2-C3 and contained two butyl esters. Comparing the 13 C spectra to 9-11 revealed that 12 lacks olefinic signals but had two deshielded esters (δC 172.4 and 171.9). The 1 H NMR spectra of 12 suggested the two butyl ester moieties at C-4 and C-6. Both methyl groups in the gem-dimethyl moiety (δH 1.11 and 0.78) exhibited HMBC correlations to both ester carbonyls, along with observed HMBC correlations between H-4 (δH 5.44) and C-13 (δC 171.9), and between H-6 (δH 4.89) and C-17 (δC 172.4).

  "outperforming GUF-1-(L-Pro/AcOH) at higher pressures (see SI, Table ). Calculating the working capacity for a cryogenic pressure swing (100 bar and 77 K → 5 bar and 77 K) system (Figure ), GUF-1-(L-Pro/AcOH), however, outperforms Ni(dobdc) by delivering ca. 26 g L -1 H2 between 100 and 5 bar (Figure ). For a combined temperature-pressure swing (100 bar and 77 K → 5 bar and 160 K) system (Figure ), GUF-1-(L-Pro/AcOH) displayed a working capacity of ca. 41 g L -1 . This was found to be comparable to the previously reported benchmark materials examined under similar conditions (Figure ). Despite the slightly lower H2 uptake at 77 K compared to the current benchmarks such as NU-125, 8 NU-1500, and NU-1501 (Figure ), the significantly lower H2 uptake at 160 K enables GUF-1-(L-Pro/AcOH) to maximise the H2 delivered in a combined temperature-pressure swing system, illustrating its great potential for use H2 storage applications.",
  "These substituents can substantially perturb the [3]-ladderene geometries relative to 1 to minimize closed-shell repulsions. We defined two parameters, an intramolecular distance, r, and a folding angle θ, to quantify the geometrical distortions (Figure ). The parameter r is the distance between the centroids of the two π-bonds, and θ is the angle between the planes of the four-membered rings. These parameters are r = 2.98 Å and θ = 118° in 1; r = 1.56 Å and θ = 90° in 2; θ = 114° in 3, optimized with PBE0/cc-pVDZ. R1 tetra-CH3-substitutions increase the r to 3.02 Å. The CH3 at R2 show opposite effects; the r and θ values decrease to 2.89 Å and 115°, maximizing the distance between adjacent substituents (Figure ). The CH3 at R2 bends the [3]-ladderenes 3° more than the CH3 at R1, introducing additional strain at the bridgehead carbons, and 4'' is 0.46 eV higher than 4' (Table ). The tetra-CF3-and cPr-substitution lead to similar geometrical distortions: the r and θ increase to 2.98-3.02 Å and 120° when substituting R1, whereas the r and θ values reduce to 2.86-2.87 Å and 114-116° when substituting R2. The energies of 7' and 10' are 0.21 and 0.59 eV lower than 7'' and 10'', respectively (Table ). Compared to 1, the r and θ parameters in the octa-substituted [3]-ladderenes, 4, 7, and 10 decreased to 2.89-2.95 Å and 116-118°. It suggests the repulsive steric interaction at R2 generates the dominant geometrical distortions. The repulsive steric interactions at R1 enlarges the angle in the 4π-disrotatory electrocyclic ring-opening products to 115-117°, compared to 3 (θ = 114°); the steric clash at R2 reduces the angle to 106-112°. Figure shows that the substituents at R1 and R2 destabilize the reaction energies by 0.24-0.55 and 0.56-0.77 eV, respectively. The greater destabilization at R2 suggests stronger steric repulsions due to the inflexibility of the substituent at the bridgehead position. The octa-substitution additively increases the destabilizing effects of the R1 and R2 tetra-substitution. The reaction energy of 6, 9, and 12 is 0.68-2.34 eV higher than 1. The octa-substitutions with CF3 and cPr switch the reaction energies from exergonic to endergonic (0.65 and 0.30 eV), indicating unfavorable 4π-disrotatory electrocyclic ring-opening to 9 and 12.",
  "Synthetic strategy. In ZIF chemistry, the link-link interactions, mainly van der Waals forces, between Im linkers stand as a crucial factor in stabilizing distinct cages and topologies, and introducing hydrogen bonds within ZIF crystals presents a challenging work. Our objective was to introduce weak hydrogen bonds ). The whole crystal structure of UZIF-31 was determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) with help from the confirmed composition using 1 H-NMR spectroscopy (Figure ). The topology of UZIF-31 exhibited an unprecedented 4,4,4-c topology with the point symbol of (4 2 .6 2 .8 2 )(4 3 .6.8 2 )(4 3 .6 2 .8) named uft1. This novel topology, uft1, was documented in the personal topology repository and not observed in any materials even zeolites. Notably, the topology of uft1 exhibits the same topological network as PCOD 8095196, also known as 4,4,4T-3872HZ, which is among hypothetical zeolites proposed by Deem et al. Interestingly, the topology of UZIF-31 is exactly matched with one of Tier 1, T-50 (Figures and). Despite a slight distortion of Im, the difference in cell volume between UZIF-31 and the predicted structure was merely +6.14 %. During topological analysis of uft1, three types of tiles compose UZIF-31 (Figure ). One of the tiles is a ] cage, which is known as the t-cub, and the others ([4 4 .6 6 .8 2 ] and [4 6 .6 2 .8 2 .12 2 ] cages) are not observed in any zeolites. The largest pore opening with a 12-membered ring (MR) was observed within the surrounding [4 6 .6 2 .8 2 .12 2 ] cage. UZIF-32 and -33 (uft2) crystallized within the orthorhombic Cmmm (No. 65) space group. The composition of crystals was confirmed by SCXRD and 1 H-NMR (Tables and; Figures and). Thus far, due to the identical net, the topological analysis of UZIF-32 has been considered the same as that of UZIF-33 for clarity. UZIF-33 also presented a novel 4,4,4-c topology with the point symbol of (4.6 4 .8)(4 2 .6 3 .8)(4 3 .6 2 .8) named uft2, not encountered in any other porous materials, including zeolite structures. Similar to uft1, the topology of uft2 shows the identical topological network with PCOD 8096930, also referred to as 4,4,4T-3884HZ, in hypothetical zeolites suggested by Deem et al. The topology of UZIF-33 is completely matched to one of Tier 1, T-12, with a slight cell volume difference of +4.68 % (Figures and).

To the best of our knowledge, UZIF-33 has the highest number of tiles (8 types) within known ZIF topologies. Among these tiles, ] cage as t-kah and [4 4 .6 4 .12 2 ] cage as t-sty were first observed in ZIF structures, while [8 .12 2 ] cage was novel and not even present in zeolites. 12-MRs as the largest pore opening were enclosed by alternating .6 4 .12 2 ] cage (t-sty) and novel [8 .12 2 ] cage.",

  "Therefore, to prepare redox-active hyperbranched polymers for RFBs, we use self-condensing vinyl copolymerization (SCVCP) to combine a water-soluble inimer and a redox-active comonomers . As traditional ATRP is susceptible to a trace of oxygen, it is unsuitable for the flow setup. Thus, we adopted the oxygen-tolerant activator regenerated by electron transfer (ARGET) ATRP technique. Its mechanism involves a process of the activator (Cu I species) continuously regenerated by a reducing agent while the Cu I /Cu II pair maintains the ATRP equilibrium. Based on previous reports on aqueous organic RFBs, we selected a viologen-bearing monomer (anolyte) and a 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidyloxy (TEMPO)-bearing monomer (catholyte) as redox-active comonomers, respectively, and an ammoniumbearing inimer, N,N-dimethyl-N-(2-methacryloyloxy)ethyl(2-bromoisobutyryloxy)ethylammonium bromide (DMEAB), at a 1:1 molar ratio to prepare the hyperbranched copolymers (HCPs).",

  "Building on these results, the substrate scope was further expanded to other EWGs as hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA). The catalytic oxidation of substrates Cn-EWG in NFTBA are presented in Table . The data shows that the 1 o sr is influenced by the nature of the EWG. Replacing OPiv by more electron withdrawing 4-nitrobenzoate (4-NBz), 3,5-dinitrobenzoate (3,5-DNBz) or CN, the 1 o sr increases substantially. For instance, the oxidation of C4-3,5-DNBz (S15) and C4-CN (S21) proceeded with two of the highest 1 o sr (14.8 and 13.8 respectively) among the Cn-EWG substrates. This improvement is even more significant for the C5 and C6 substrates.

Peptides were purified by RP-HPLC. Elution was performed at a flow rate of 10 mL/min using a linear gradient of acetonitrile and ultrapure water (both containing 0.1% LCMS grade formic acid). The gradient ranged from 20% to 80% acetonitrile over 1 hour. UV absorption at 220 nm and 254 nm was used to monitor the collection of unprotected peptides.

  "Transition-metal-catalyzed additions across π-systems have been extensively explored and have similarly been employed to control the reactivity of 2-azetines (Fig. ). In this area, Zhang and co-workers developed a nickel-catalyzed aryldifluoroalkylation across the alkene of 2-azetines (44) that affords trans-disubstituted azetidines (45). This metalcatalyzed transformation of 2-azetines (44) proceeded with a diastereoselectivity greater than 20:1, and produced azetidines with ester or amide functionality for subsequent modifications such as amide couplings. Functionalized β-lactams are a well-established motif that have demonstrated medicinal properties. 62-65 1-Azetines have been identified by researchers as precursors to functionalized β-lactam rings under a variety of reaction conditions (Fig 4D). The first example of a 1-azetine being converted to a β-lactam was disclosed by Atkinson and co-workers. The Atkinson group showed that two different 1-azetines (46, R 1 =Cl or MeO, R 2 =Ph, R 3 =Cl, R 4 =Me, R 5 =H) were converted to the same Nhydro β-lactam (47) upon exposure to 10% hydrochloric acid. Likewise, Aue and Thomas were able to synthesize a N-methyl β-lactam (47, R 2 =R 3 =Me, R 4 =R 5 =H) from a 1-azetine (46, R 1 =OMe) via a thermally induced Chapman rearrangement. Ghosez and co-workers developed a general protocol that allows conversion of a 1-azetine (46, R 1 =NMe2, R 2 =R 3 =Me, R 4 =Ph, R 5 =H) to β-lactams with an N-electrophile bond (47) in the presence of an electrophile such as methyl iodide or acrylonitrile following basic hydrolysis. Pifferi and co-workers synthesized a series of 1-azetines (46, R 1 =OEt, R 2 =alkyl or aryl, R 3 =alkyl or aryl, R 4 =R 5 =H) from beta lactams (47). The authors observed that anhydrous hydrochloric acid in ethereal solvents reverted 1-azetines (46) to the corresponding β-lactams (47) from which they were formed. The four protocols described (vide supra) allow access to highly functionalized β-lactams from 1-azetines and proceed through different mechanisms, which highlights the potential of 1-azetines as useful building blocks to access β-lactam rings.",

  "Arguably, both %𝑛 𝜎 and %𝑛 𝑏 are strongly influenced by EV diameter.

According to the calculation, smaller EVs carry more proteins on their surface (blue dashed line) than in their bulk (red dashed line) and vice versa. Protein repartition eventually reaches a switch point (%𝑛 𝜎 = %𝑛 𝑏 ) at d =180 nm (fig. , black-dotted line), within the size range typical of S-EVs (50-200 nm). The trend then inverts, with bulk proteins quickly overtaking surface ones, until the ratios stabilize in the size range typical of larger EVs, such as large oncosomes (d > 1000 nm).",

  "Under the established reaction conditions, we first explored the scope of aryl halide in this enantioconvergent cross-coupling (Table 2). A wide range of aryl halides with electron-donating groups (3b-3d) or electron-withdrawing groups (3i-3v) were viable substrates under standard conditions. Moreover, the reaction was not sensitive to steric resistance, and the ortho-substituted substrates (3e, 3f) were converted to the desired products in good yields with high er values. A series of aryl electrophiles possessing functional groups, such as ketones (3i-3k), aldehydes (3l), esters (3m) amide (3n), alkyl nitrile substrates (3o), aryl nitrile at para (3p), meta (3q), or ortho (3r) positions, as well as sulfones (3u, 3v) were all well accommodated without any traces of functional group interconversion. Furthermore, the reaction also showed good compatibility with OAc (3w) or boronic esters (3x), which can be further functionalized via traditional cross-coupling reactions. Remarkably, the introduction of heterocycles, such as quinoline (3y, 3z), benzothiazole (4a), indole (4b, 4c), benzofuran (4d), phenothiazine (4e), pyrimidine (4f, 4g) did not diminish the reaction efficiency, affording the desired corresponding products with high levels of enantiocontrol.

For instance, substrates bearing clofibrate (4h), fenofibrate (4i), indometacin (4k), and derivatives of amino acids (4j) and cholesterol (4l) could be employed to provide the corresponding products in moderate to good yields with excellent ee, which underscore the potential application for rapid modification of drugs and natural products.",

  "Additionally, other anionic fluorine sources were found to be ineffective in this reaction (entry 13). Using Selectfluor as the oxidant provided an acceptable yield, although the diastereomeric ratio decreased to 6:1 (entry 14). As expected, the transformation did not proceed in the absence of the iodine catalyst (entry 15). groups (5-6 and 8) underwent the dearomative difluorination with moderate to good yields ranging from 40% to 72%. 3-Methylindoles carrying a trifluoromethyl or carbonyl substituent at the 6-position were generally compatible with the reaction conditions (9-10). Disubstituted 3-methylindoles yielded the corresponding products in good yields (11). Notably, indoles featuring different N-acyl protecting groups such as benzoyl, pivaloyl, or acetyl underwent the reaction smoothly, leading to good yields of the desired products (12-14). Importantly, the protocol was not limited to 3-methylindoles alone. A series of N-SO2Ph-indoles bearing electron-withdrawing substituents, including nitro, ester and cyano at various positions, were also amenable to the reaction conditions, albeit with slightly reduced yields (15-20). Encouragingly, by introducing stronger electron-withdrawing N-protecting groups, even weakly electron-poor 2,3-dihydroindoles were tolerated, providing moderate yields of the desired products (21-24). the successful transformation of indoles with varying alkyl chain lengths (25, 29).

Moreover, the lamellar d-spacing for pFAST-20-Li + G4 (35.7 Å) was greater than that for dry pFAST-C20-Li (33.4 Å) by 2.3 Å, which is within the expected size difference of reported Li + coordinated by G4 or crown ethers compared to Li + alone. DSC analysis (Figure ) showed Tg and Tm transitions for pFAST-C20-Li + G4 that were >100 °C lower than for the dry ionene, indicative of plasticization, which is expected to increase ion conductivity. Finally, crystallization of G4 (Tc = -9.4 °C) was not observed, suggesting the presence of minimal bulk G4.",
  "Inhibition by 2a and 3a was evaluated on DXPS enzymes from four different species, namely, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Deinococcus radiodurans and E. coli. Both were inhibitors of EcDXPS (87-92% inhibition at 1 mM), consistent with earlier reports, but they had low activity on KpDXPS, PaDXPS and DrDXPS (<16% inhibition at 1 mM * ) (Table ). The selectivity of 2a and 3a as inhibitors of DXPS over other ThDP-dependent enzymes has not yet been reported, so they were also tested against four other ThDP-dependent enzymes: they showed inhibition of porcine PDH E1 (52-71% inhibition at 100 µM) but lacked activity on PDC, PO and OGDH E1 (<5% inhibition at 250 µM).",
  "The lower diffusion resistance and larger capacitance from EIS plots suggest improved pore accessibility and increased pore wettability enhancing specific capacitcance. Overall, SSA experiments with 15% CO2/5% O2/80% N2 gas mixture using 3M MgBr2 attained record adsorption capacity of ∼750 mmol.kg -1 at an energy consumption of ∼300 kJ.mol -1 at 0.6V, while low energy consumption of 85 kJ.mol -1 with a reversible adsorption capacity of ∼66 mmol.kg -1 was achieved at 0.4 V. The influence of oxygen on CO2 adsorption was further investigated with 3M MgCl2 (Figure and Figure ), another deliquescent electrolyte. When a 15% CO2/85% N2 gas mixture is used, CO2 sorption profiles during charging and discharging behave very similarly to those shown by electrodes infiltrated with 3M MgBr2 electrolyte (Figure and Figure ). A capacitance of ∼80 F.g -1 , a resistance of ∼9 Ω.cm 2 , a CO2 adsorption capacity of 75 mmol.kg -1 , an adsorption rate of ∼32 μmol.kg -1 .s -1 , a coulombic efficiency of ∼98%, an energy efficiency of ∼80%, an energy loss of ∼4J and an energy consumption of ∼73 kJ.mol -1 were measured (Figure ).

  "A recent work from our group has successfully utilised the reaction of white phosphorus (P4) with heterobimetallic complexes to prepare unusual polyphosphorus compounds. Using this strategy, we have now synthesised the heavy tetraphospholide anions SnP4 2-and PbP4 2-. These hitherto unknown -aromatic molecules are stabilised by the coordination to two cobalt atoms in the triple-decker sandwich compounds [(η 4 -tBu2C2P2)2Co2(μ,η 5 :η 5 -P4Tt)] [Tt = Sn (6), Pb (7)]. We describe the structural and spectroscopic characterization of these complexes and analyse the electronic structure of the P4Tt 2─ ligands with quantum chemical methods. The molecular structures of 1-3 were determined by singlecrystal X-ray diffraction. Since all three structures share the same motif, only the molecular structure of 2 is displayed in Figure , while those of 1 and 3 are shown in the SI (Figures and). The cobalt atoms feature η 4 -coordinated 1,5-cyclooctadiene and 1,3-diphosphacyclobutadiene ligands, while the tetrel atom (Ge, Sn, or Pb) is in a pseudo-two-coordinate environment by terphenyl-substituent and one of the P atoms of the diphosphacyclobutadiene ligand. The Tt-P bond lengths in 1-3 (2.3946(8) Å, 2.6442(7) Å, 2.7402(10) Å, respectively) are similar to those of tertiary phosphine adducts of tetrelylenes. The Tt-Co distances in 1-3 (Ge-Co 2.8434(6) Å, Sn-Co 2.9534(5) Å, Pb-Co: 3.0318(6) Å) are longer than the sum of their covalent radii (∑rGeCo 2.70 Å, ∑rSnCo 2.89 Å, ∑rPbCo 2.96 Å). These parameters suggest the absence of a covalent metal-metal bond, which is in line with quantum chemical calculations (vide infra). By contrast, a previously reported, related cluster compound (Ar′SnCo)2 features strong covalent Sn-Co bonds, which even have partial multiple bond character. It is noteworthy that although the Tt-Co and Tt-P distances for 1-3 increase down the group, the bond angles are approximately the same (C1-Tt-Co1 127°-129°, C1-Tt-P1 102°-103°). As a consequence of the relatively short atomic radius of germanium, the terphenyl substituent and the Co( ), C1-Sn1-P1 102.17 (7). This is presumably due to the large chemical shift anisotropy of the signals and/or relaxation effects as previously observed for the (Ar′SnCo)2 cluster. Intrinsic bond orbital (IBO), natural bond orbital (NBO) and Atoms in Molecules (AIM) analyses of DFT calculated electron densities were employed to analyse the bonding situation in 1-3. The IBO analyses show the expected bond-like localised molecular orbitals. Additionally, there is a delocalised MO between the tetrel, coordinating phosphorus and cobalt centres, but with low contributions from Co (1: Ge (24%) Co (8%) P (59%), 2: Sn (14%) Co (10%) P (59%), 3: Pb (13%) Co (10%) P (59%)). The Wiberg bond indices for Ge-Co, Sn-Co and Pb-Co likage in 1-3 (0.20, 0.15 and 0.13, respectively) are lower than expected for a covalent bond. In line with the results from DFT, the AIM analysis shows bond critical point (BCP) between cobalt and phosphorus, as well as the tetrel atoms and phosphorus (see Figure and SI). However, no BCPs were found between the tetrel atoms and the cobalt centre. All these results indicate the presence of only a weak interaction between Tt and Co. It was also possible to synthesise the homoleptic tin(II) complex Sn[Co(η 4 -P2C2tBu2)(COD)]2 (4) by reacting E with commercially available Sn(acac)2 (Figure ). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction on 4 revealed that the tin atom is coordinated by the two P atoms of the diphosphacyclobutadiene ligands with Sn-P distances (Sn1-P1 2.6490 (10), Sn1-P2 2.6484(10) Å) similar to 2 and a P-Sn-P angle of 102.17 Having compounds 1-4 at hand, we studied their reactivity towards P4 to ascertain whether they can be used as precursors to novel polyphosphorus compounds. Reactions between 1 and P4 were unsuccessful. While no reaction occurs at ambient temperature, heating to 55 °C affords an intractable mixture of products according to 31 P NMR spectra (see Figure , SI). By contrast, reactions of 2 or 4 with P4 at elevated temperatures afford dark red, crystalline compound [(tBu2C2P2)2Co2(μ,η 5 :η 5 -SnP4)] (6) in each case (Figure ). When using 2, separation of 6 from the terphenyl containing by-products proved difficult due to their similar solubility. Fortunately, reaction of 4 with P4 forms 6 selectively at ambient temperature, with 1,5-cycloctadiene being the only by-product, making isolation facile and allowing the crystallographic characterisation of 6 by singlecrystal X-ray diffraction (Figure ). The crystallographic analysis reveals the formation of a triple decker complex of two (η 4 -P2C2tBu2)Co units and a planar cyclo-SnP4 middle deck, for which a pronounced alternation of the P-P bond lengths is observed. The P-P bonds adjacent to the Sn atom (P1-P2 Internal 2.1101( ) and P3-P4 2.094(4) Å) approach the range for a P=P double bond. The P2-P3 bond length (2.2296(11) Å) suggests the presence of a single bond. The bond lengths between phosphorus and tin (av. P-Sn 2.52865( ) Å are comparable to the single bonds found in diphosphastannylenes. The 31 P{ 1 H} spectrum of 6 shows one singlet and two multiplets with an integral ratio of 4:2:2. The singlet at δ = 67.1 ppm can be assigned to the P atoms within the P2C2tBu2 rings. One of the two multiplet signals (δ = 29.6 and 77.0 ppm), the highfield shifted signal shows coupling to 117/119 Sn, allowing for its definitive assignment to the P atoms adjacent to the Sn atom (P1 and P4). Simulation of the 31 P{ 1 H} spectrum by an iterative fitting procedure gave a 1 JPP coupling constant of ─434.7 Hz for the P1-P2/P3-P4 pairs, whereas the 1 JPP coupling for P2-P3 (magnetically not equivalent) it is ─289.0 Hz (see Figure , SI). A 119 Sn NMR spectrum of 6, shows a broad triplet at δ = 339.7 ppm with a 1 JSnP coupling constant of 797 Hz, which is in agreement with the simulated 31 P{ 1 H} NMR spectrum (see the SI). The line broadening of the 119 Sn NMR is likely due to interactions with the quadrupolar 59 Co nuclei. 22 ), Sn1-P4 2.5375( ), P1-P2 2.1101( ), P2-P3 2.2296( ), P3-P4 2.1104( ), Co1-Co2 3.050, P1-Sn1-P4 88.17( ), Sn1-P1-P2 118.23(4), P1-P2-P3 107.96( ), P2-P3-P4 107.60( ), P3-P4-Sn1 118.02(4); c) Sections of the measured (upward) and simulated (downward) P{ 1 H} NMR spectrum of 6.",

  "A hybrid material composed of Ag nanoparticles (~66.4 wt. % of silver) deposited in situ at g-CN fibers upon calcining Ag-cyanoguanidine complex produces formaldehyde from methanol. Binuclear complex, [Me2(C16H33)2N]4[Pt2(pop-BF2)4] (see Figure for chemical structure), which comprise chromophore (onset of absorption at ~380 nm), photoredox and H2-evolution sites (Pt), mediate dehydrogenation of benzylic alcohols and nitrogen-containing heterocycles (Figure ). When reaction was performed in homogeneous fashion, i.e., using water/organic solvent mixture (2:1) in which all components are fully soluble, the catalyst yields up to 78% diphenylbutandiol. Employing two-phase system, water/CH2Cl2 (1:3) and the phase transfer reagent Bu4NCl, shifted selectivity completely to acetophenone. K4[Pt2(pop-BF2)4], however, failed to enable dehydrogenation of aliphatic alcohols. [Me2(C16H33)2N]4[Pt2(pop-BF2)4], which excited state is a stronger oxidant compared to K4[Pt2(pop-BF2)4], Ered +0.85 vs. +0.70 V (Fc + /Fc), 298 catalyzes dehydrogenation of secondary aliphatic alcohols upon irradiation at 365 nm. While primary alcohols, such as ethanol and n-butanol gave the corresponding aldehydes with <10% yield, butanediol-1,4 and pentanediol-1,5 gave γ-butyrolactone and δ-valerolactone with yields as high as 83%. KIE values (kH/kD = 3.35) obtained from intra-and intermolecular competition experiments revealed that cleavage of C(sp 3 )-H bond in α-position to hydroxyl group is the rate-limiting step. Dehydrogenation of indoline in the presence of styrene gives phenylethyl indole, which supports involvement of Pt2-hydride and Pt2-CH(CH3)Ph, i.e., Pt acts as a catalytic site, while the reaction proceeds via inner sphere atom abstraction. Given that in anhydrous environment, pinacol coupling product is formed, it is likely that intermediary ketyl radicals remain bound to Pt long enough so that dimerization competes effectively with hydrogen atom transfer with the liberation of H2 and aldehyde. A catalytic system composed [Mes-Acr-Me]ClO4, thiophosphoric acid and Ni(Tf2)2 enables dehydrogenation of aliphatic alcohols to aldehydes (Figure ). Using the same catalytic system, esters were obtained from aldehydes and trichloroethanol with evolution of one H2 equivalent. Comparison of the ketone yield obtained from benzhydrol (11%) and dicyclohexylmethanol (72%) revealed that the reaction proceeds via β-hydride elimination from Ni species -the latter has β-C-H bond, while the former -does not. Dehydrogenation of admanatanol gave non-enolizable ketone with low (27%) yield suggesting the reaction proceeds via enol intermediate. Using cyclododecanol-d4 as the substrate, gave ketone with relatively high (84%) enrichment in H vs. D, again suggesting formation of enol. CdS modified with Ni (0) nanoparticles, which were photochemically deposited using NiCl2 enables dehydrogenation of methanol to formaldehyde. Differently from other reports, no H2 evolved in the absence of Ni salts. The AQY is 95% at 405 nm.",

  "In a dried two-necked 50 ml round bottomed flask, POCl3 (0.52 ml, 5.60 mmol) was added dropwise at 0 °C under an inert nitrogen atmosphere to dry DMF (0.43 ml, 5.60 mmol) with vigorous stirring. After some time, dry CH2Cl2 (5 ml) was added to this reaction mixture and left for stirring at 0 °C for 45 minutes under inert atmosphere to obtain a Vilsmeier reagent. This prepared reagent was later on added dropwise at 0º C under inert atmosphere to a stirred solution of compound 3 (2.40 g, 5.60 mmol) in dry CH2Cl2 (100 ml) prepared in another two-necked 250 ml round bottomed flask. The solution turns dark red and was left for stirring at 0 °C for 2 h. After the completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was thoroughly washed with saturated aqueous Na2CO3 and NaCl. The organic contents were extracted in CH2Cl2, dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated over vacuum to afford crude red solid. This crude mixture was later on subjected to column chromatography (SiO2, CH2Cl2 followed by 5% CH2Cl2:ethyl acetate) to get pure 4 (0.537 g, 21% yield, white solid).

  "diPAPs were detected as complex mixtures of several structural isomers depending on their chain-length (e.g., 6:2/10:2 and 8:2/8:2, shown by MS/MS). Additionally, their EICs showed peaks at much later RTs corresponding to in-source fragments of triPAPs (Fig. ). While all telomer-based PFAS were detected as linear chains, the PASF-based PFAS (PFSAs, N-EtFOSAA, PFOSA, and diSAmPAP) showed typical chromatographic peak shapes of mixtures of branched and linear isomers . In these cases, the dominance of a C8-based chemistry can be observed (see PFSAs in Fig. ).",
  "P(AAm-co-BMDO) were synthesized following a previously developed procedure and adapted as follows. Two initial AAm:BMDO molar ratios (56:44 and 57:43) were tested. For P(AAm-co-BMDO) 56:44 (P5), AAm (112 eq., 4.48 mmol, 0.32 g), BMDO (88 eq., 3.52 mmol, 0.57 g) (total mole = 8 mmol), CDP (1 eq., 0.04 mmol, 16.1 mg) and AIBN (0.6 eq., 0.024 mmol, 3.9 mg) were dissolved into anhydrous DMSO (10 mL). The solution was bubbled with dry argon to remove dissolved oxygen for 20 min at room temperature and then immersed in a preheated oil bath at 70 °C for 16 h. The solution was then rapidly cooled under air. The copolymer was precipitated into cold methanol and then washed three times with cold methanol followed by centrifugation (5,000 rpm, 10 min).

  "Interestingly, the initial screening shows that Ru-3 exhibits high catalytic activity, comparable to Ru-1 at 120 °C (Entry 5 vs Entry 1). At the same temperature, Ru-2 and the phosphine complexes Ru-6 and Ru-7 also demonstrate good conversion rates (75%, 99%, and 94%, respectively) and yields towards GVL (76%, 87%, and 82%, respectively, entries 3, 9, and 11). In contrast, Ru-4, Ru-5, and Ru-11 show lower conversion rates (entries 7, 8, and 13). Based on ATR-IR data, hydride NMR shifts, and XRD bond lengths, this outcome was expected for the DMF complex (Ru-4) but unexpected for the DMSO complex (Ru-5). Moreover, the vastly different outcomes based on different trans ligands suggests that these ligands, or at least most of them, either stay coordinated to Ru or dissociate only slowly under these thermally harsh conditions.",

It is noteworthy that 3A5EF-derived DA adducts 2a and 2b showed higher combined yield (76%) in comparison to two chitin-derived analogues. These results strengthen the use of 3A5EF to further investigations.",
  "Accessing piperazine-fused 1,2-thiaselenanes (SeSPs) faces two challenges: ring fusion diastereoselectivity (cis/trans), and regioselective chalcogen installation (SeS/SSe), that both were predicted to completely determine the biological selectivity. For diastereoselectivity, we could adapt routes to cis-/trans-piperazinefused disulfides that we previously 9 built by subjecting E/Z-olefins to Minakata's 1,2-anti-diamination then Ritter's 1,2-electrophile vinyl thianthrenium (VTT). However, we found no precedent to regioselectively access the desired Se-proximal probes (SeSC type) rather than the Se-distal control (SSeC type), so developing a scalable regiopure synthesis became our main focus. We aimed to set up orthogonal N-protecting groups in a common precursor 7, that could be removed selectively: e.g. replacing PG 1 to create Se-proximal probes, or PG 2 for Se-distal controls (Figure ).",
  "We prepared 1mM and 100 mM stock solutions of NaCl (>99.8%, Roth) and CaCl2 (dihydrate, ≥99.9%, p.a., ACS, ROTH) using sterile, DNA-and nuclease-free water (Roth) and adjusted the pH with 1 M NaOH or 1M HCl (FIXANAL, Fluka Analytical). We used short DNA strands (from salmon testes, ~30 bp, Roth) representative of degraded, ancient DNA. We prepared fresh DNA stock solution of 2 mgml -1 or 1 mgml -1 using NaCl or CaCl2 stock before each adsorption and intercalation experiment. The pH of DNA stock was additionally adjusted with 0.1 mM NaOH or 0.1 mM HCl.

  "To improve transfection performance, we prepared lipopolyplexes from both the responsive and control polyplexes at a mass ratio of lipid:pDNA = 10:1 (Figure ). Again, the lipid mixture of DC-Chol/DOPE (70/30) was used, as has already been successfully applied in lipopolyplex preparations. The lipopolyplexes (N/P = 4) were characterised by DLS, yielding a size of 334 ± 9 nm for the responsive lipopolyplex (L1a-4) and 2.45 ± 1.8 µm for the control lipopolyplex (L1b-4). The complexes were positively charged, with ZP values of 15.4 mV (L1a-4) and 16.9 mV (L1b-4). TEM images revealed the formation of layered or walled structures, which tended to aggregate under TEM imaging conditions (Figure ).",
  "Oxidation to monoanions is particularly challenging as the electrochemical stability window for this valence state calculated as the difference between Ered 1-/0 and Eox 2-/1-(see Table ) is narrow: 285 mV in THF, 227 mV in MeCN, 158 mV in DCM and only 109 mV in DMF. A suitable oxidant needs to meet several requirements: 1e -oxidation must take place in a narrow electrochemical window, the oxidant must be soluble either in THF or MeCN and should facilitate the removal of the redundant organic cations. Ce(IV) in the form of the tetrabutylammonium salt of [Ce IV (NO3)6] 2-anion: (NBu4)2[Ce IV (NO3)6] (CTAN) was found to be suitable (Ce IV /Ce III couple E1/2 = +0.610 V vs Fc/Fc + in MeCN, Figure in the SI). However, the corresponding oxidation of (NBu4)2tripak (2-a) resulted in the formation of a mixed-valence salt, in which each tripak anion was accompanied by 1.5 NBu4 + cations: (NBu4)1.5tripak•4THF (1-b) that leads to the conclusion that it comprises both tripak 1-and tripak 2-in a 1:1 ratio. Therefore, another oxidant was used to prepare tripak 1-: [Fe III (phen)3](PF6)3 with formal potential of the Fe III /Fe II couple E1/2 = +0.696 V vs Fc/Fc + in MeCN, Figure in the SI). Oxidation of (NBu4)2tripak (2-a) in MeCN with [Fe III (phen)3](PF6)3 proceeds smoothly resulting in the formation of tripak 1-salt that incorporates the diamagnetic [Fe II (phen)3] 2+ as the countercation and PF6 -as an additional counteranion: [Fe II (phen",

  "With fluorobenzene and 3,4-dimethylfluorobenzene, the corresponding dibenzofurans 6a and 6b were obtained in 82% and 53%, respectively (Table ). In the case of fluoroanisoles, fluorine proved to be a stronger directing group under superbasic metalation conditions as demonstrated by the formation of 6c and 6d. The structure of 6c was confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction. 17 Furthermore, 1,4-and 1,2-difluorobenzene provided the corresponding fluoro substituted dibenzofurans 6e and 6f in reasonable yield. Finally, the 2bromophenyl acetates 3 coupling partner was varied delivering 6d'-e' and 6g-i in 39-64% yield. Here, dibenzofurans 6e/e' and 6i have been reported as precursors for the synthesis of host materials for blue phosphorescent OLEDs. With dibenzofurans 6d and 6d' as well as 6e and 6e' being pairs of identical compounds, our methodology allows flexibility in terms of the choice of starting materials 1 and 3 (Scheme 3). Hereby, slightly higher yields have been achieved utilizing fluorobenzene (1b) and substituted 2-bromophenyl acetates 3 via path b. Unfortunately, the synthesis of dibenzothiophenes was not successful under these reaction conditions generating 2-bromothiophenol as main product from the corresponding acetate 3. In conclusion, we have developed an efficient one-pot procedure for the facile assembly of fused benzofuro heterocycles. Fluoropyridines or fluoroarenes were subjected to a directed ortho-lithiation followed by zincation and Negishi cross-coupling with 2-bromophenyl acetates.

  "With the aim of screening the samples for thermal phase changes, additional cyclic DSC experiments (two upscans, one downscan) were performed between ambient temperature and Td also under N2 atmosphere (Figures 6, S74-77 and S85). Excitingly, the ZIFs which are known glass formers (ZIF-62(M), ZIF-4(M), ZIF-zni(Zn), ZIF-76/UC-5 and TIF-4) exhibit a welldefined glass transition signal in the first upscan of the DSC already after only 5 minutes of PSBM (Figures and). Hence, these PSBM-amorphized materials represent ZIF MIGs that transition to a supercooled liquid upon heating. This proves that the vitrification of these compounds can be achieved by ball milling at room temperature instead of heating across the materials' melting points, followed by melt-quenching. The DSC data of both ZIF-4(Zn/Co) and ZIF-zni(Zn/Co) reveal distinct thermal characteristics (Figure and). Similar to crystalline ZIF-4(Zn), which recrystallizes to ZIF-zni(Zn) after thermal amorphization, the MIGs ZIF-4(Zn)-5min, -10min and -15min, also recrystallize to the ZIF-zni(Zn) polymorph after passing through their glass transition (confirmed by variable temperature XRPD, Figure ).

  "Figure depicts the array of aliphatic alkenes that participate in efficient aziridination. Yields are based on isolated N-pyridinium aziridines from reactions on 0.30 mmol scale; in some cases, both NMR and isolated yields are provided to emphasize that aziridination is typically efficient but isolation of highly polar N-pyridinium aziridines can be challenging. Cyclic alkenes (cyclohexene, cyclopentene, cyclooctene, and 3-carene) engaged in efficient aziridination to afford pyridinium aziridines 5a to 5d, respectively. Five-and six-membered aziridines are formed with exclusively cis-stereochemistry. For 8-membered cyclic alkenes, both cis-and trans-aziridines are observed (c-5c : t-5c = 6.25 : 1.00; 73% yield). Cis-5c could be isolated at analytical purity and the stereochemical assignment was based on measured coupling constants in the 1 H NMR spectrum. Assignment of cis-/ trans-mixtures was bolstered by aziridination with 1,5cyclooctadiene 5f, which afforded a 1.0 : 1.0 c-5f : t-5f mixture (69% yield, Figure ). The transstereochemistry of t-5f was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Norbornene undergoes exo-aziridination to afford 5e in 69% yield; the stereochemistry of aziridination was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) following cross coupling (vide infra). Terminal alkenes with different functional groups including alkyl halide, ester, nitrile, and azide underwent aziridination with good yield (5g to 5p). N-Heterocycles were tolerated as demonstrated in the aziridination of 2q. With 4-vinyl homoallylbenzene 2r, aziridination occurred selectively at the styrenyl C=C bond to afford 5r in 65% isolated yield. imine by-products (vide infra); for carvone, the imine byproduct (5z') was isolated in 18% yield.",

  "Similarly, the stability of the Nucleocapsid CTD complexed with fortunellin was examined. The RMSD value was observed to vary between 0.70 ±.12 nm (figure )). The low fluctuations indicate that the protease has not undergone significant structural changes. The Rg value varied within a narrow range of 1.7±0.1 nm, suggesting the compactness and integrity of the produced complex (figure )). The distance between fortunellin and nucleocapsid CTD was found to a minimum of 0.2 nm (figure )). The important residues had a low RMSF value of 0.25 nm on average throughout the simulation (figure )). Throughout the simulation, there are an average of 2-3 H-bonds, showing the protein-ligand complex's stability (figure )). Furthermore, we used the representative snapshot of the most populated cluster acquired from the 70-100ns simulations to analyze the CTD-fortunellin interactions. Fortunellin showed non-polar hydrophobic interactions with Phe274, Phe286, Ile304, Ala305, Phe307, Ala308, Pro309, Ala311, Phe314, Phe315, Trp330, Leu331, Tyr333, Ala336, Ile337, Leu353, and Ile357 residues in complex with nucleocapsid C-terminal dimerization domain.

  "Informed by a decade of endeavors in developing aqueous anthraquinone flow batteries, 35-41 we selected three anthraquinone derivatives that are aqueous-soluble at neutral pH: 2,7-disulfonated anthraquinone (AQDS), 1,8-bis(2-(2-(2-hydroxyethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)anthracene-9,10-dione (AQ-1,8-3E-OH), and 2,2′-((9,10-dioxo-9,10dihydroanthracene-2,6-diyl)bis(oxy))-dipropionic acid (2,6-D2PEAQ) (Figure ). Although those quinones show decent aqueous solubility in both oxidized and reduced states, bright yellow precipitates formed when CO2 was introduced to the reduced electrolytes. The yellow precipitates did not form, and clear solutions were afforded when tetra-alkyl ammonium chlorides were used as the supporting salts (Figure , Table ). Specifically, substituting 1 M NaCl with 1 M tetramethylammonium chloride (TMACl) as the supporting salt in 0.1 M AQDS electrolyte (Figure ), replacing 1 M KCl with 1 M tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBACl) as the supporting salt in 0.1 M 2,6-D2PEAQ (Figure ) or in 0.1 M AQ-1,8-3E-OH electrolytes produce transparent bright yellow solutions. One plausible explanation is that the bulky, amphiphilic tetra-alkyl ammonium cations and Q(CO2)2 2-can form loose ion pairs rather than the tight ion pairs between alkali metal cations and Q(CO2)2 2-. There are more water molecules separating positively and negatively charged ions in loose ion pairs than in tight ion pairs, weakening the Coulomb attraction and enhancing solubility. However, the bulkiness of tetra-alkyl ammonium cations causes extremely high cell resistance (Figure ) in the flow cell systems because, in such cells, cation-exchange membranes must be used, resulting in prohibitively high energetic cost. Inspired by the observation of dramatic change in aqueous solubility of reduced AQs in the presence of CO2 caused by tetra-alkyl ammonium salts (Figure , Table ), we hypothesized that anthraquinone derivatives tethered with bulky alkyl ammonium cations via covalent bonds might not only have high aqueous solubility in all states, but also be compatible with anion exchange membranes: the oxidized forms are positively charged and the reduced forms are charge-neutral but large in size, with correspondingly low expected cross-over rates. We designed and synthesized 1,4-, 1,5-, 1,8-, and 2,6-bis [3-(trimethylammonio)propyl]-anthraquinone (BTMAPAQs) in which the numbers represent the positions of water-solubilizing chains (TMAP) bonded to anthraquinone (AQ) core. Of the four isomers, 2,6-BTMAPAQ exhibits very limited solubility (< 0.1 M) even in its oxidized state (Table ); 1,8-BTMAPAQ(CO2)2 2-becomes soluble when TBA + is used as the supporting salt cation (Figure ); 1,4-, and 1,5-BTMAPAQs are soluble in all states even if KCl is used as the supporting salt. Therefore, 1,4-, 1,5-, and 1,8-BTMAPAQs (Figure ) were investigated for electrochemical CO2 capture. . (e) NMR specimens, from left to right in the same order as the molecular structures in (d), and their 1 H NMR (f) and 13 C NMR (g) spectra. Note that 1 H NMR peak broadening was initially observed from the electrochemically reduced aqueous quinone due to the occurrence of residual radicals, but addition of a tiny amount of HCl afforded well-defined peak splitting in the aromatic region (Figure , orange). The chemical shift at 124.6 ppm in 1,5-BTMAPAQ(CO2)2 2-(Figure , purple, identified with asterisk) is from the dissolved CO2. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to investigate BTMAPAQs in buffered and unbuffered solutions. As shown in Figure , at pH 7 in N2, 1,5-BTMAPAQ exhibits a redox potential of -0.465 V vs. SHE with a peak separation of 90 mV. When the solution was constantly purged with CO2, the major cathodic peak appears at -0.51 V along with a minor cathodic peak at -0.28 V (Figure ), which might be caused by a CO2 buffering effect, enabling 1,5-BTMAPAQ to partially undergo a PCET process. The anodic peak of 1,5-BTMAPAQ largely shifts to +0.28 V, suggesting that extra energy is required to trigger the electrochemical oxidation: 1,5-BTMAPAQ(CO2)2 2-à 1,5-BTMAPAQ + 2CO2 + 2e -. Similar electrochemical behaviors were also shown by 1,4-and 1,8-BTMAPAQs.",

The cyclopropanation of terminal alkene was not observed with electron-rich siloxy cupper carbene species under our conditions. The piperonyl substituted acylsilane 4n couple with benzoxazole in 53% yield. The acylsilane bearing thienyl group (4o) is also reactive under our conditions.

  "G305 in the K-helix of SdS (corresponding to S303 in AS and H320 in Gd11olS) was investigated next. Although replacement of G305 with H and D did not change the product profile, replacement with E resulted in the formation of the sesquiterpene alcohol selin-7(11)-en-4-ol (10, 20%), which is not produced by wild-type, along with selina-4(15),7(11)-diene as a major product (52.9%, Figure , Table ). Notably, G305E caused a more significant change in the active site water cluster compared to G305D in our FDP-complex MD simulations (Figure ). Formation of selin-7(11)-en-4-ol ( ) is expected to arise from hydroxylation of carbocation B on C3, instead of deprotonation of C15 to form selina-4(15),7(11)-diene (2, Scheme 1). SdS W304S and SdS W304E were also created, as this is expected to increase water availability around carbocation B (see e.g., Figure ), but these variants did not result in hydroxylated product formation: both variants produced germacrene B (3) as major product along with reduced level of selina-4(15),7(11)-diene (2) (Figure , Table ).",

  "To assess the potential contribution of a chain mechanism, we determined the quantum yield (Φ) of the reaction. Using potassium ferrioxalate actinometry, we established a radiant flux of 9.6 ± 0.6 nE/s. 32a, Irradiating the reaction with substrate 1a for a one-hour under identical conditions gave a quantum yield of ΦCe = 0.0025 ± 0.0008 and ΦCe-free = 0.00111 ± 0.00008 (see SI for details). Theese low quantum yields (Φ ≪ 1) suggest that a chain reaction is unlikely but cannot be entirely ruled out based on these experiments alone. 32c Poor excited-state quenching kinetics may also contribute to the low Φ-values, as indicated by our steady-state emission kinetics experiments. 32c Additionally, Julia's pioneering work on HAT cyclizations of C(sp³-H) acids shows that short, inefficient chains are possible. Based on these mechanistic investigations, we propose the following tentative catalytic cycles (Scheme 3). Under cerium-employing conditions A, we propose an Xligand exchange between the putative complex [Et4N]3[Ce III Cl6] and LiTFA to give a Ce(III)•O2CCF3 complex. The β-ketoester substrates then coordinate with this Ce(III)carboxylate, triggering a metalation deprotonation event that exchanges carboxylate and enolate ligands. The newly formed ketoester•Ce(III) complex is then oxidized by photoexcited 9,10-DPA* to give a ketoester•Ce(IV) complex and radical anion 9,10-DPA •-(E1/2(DPA/DPA •-) = -1.80 V vs SCE in MeCN). The Ce(IV)•ketoester complex may then undergo thermal or photochemical LMCT, oxidizing the ketoester to furnish radical II and reducing Ce(IV) back to /PhS -) = +0.16 V vs SCE in MeCN). Thiolate V then deprotonates trifluoroacetic acid, regenerating carboxylate X and yielding TRIPSH (VI) (pKa(S-H) ~7 in water, pKa(CF3COO-H) -0.25 in water). HAT from TRIPSH (VI) to C-centred radical III regenerates thiyl species IV simultaneously forming the closed shell ketolactone product 2a (BDE(TRIPS-H) ~83 kcal/mol, BDE (primary alkyl C-H) ~100 kcal/mol, kHAT ~1x10 8 M -1 s -1 ). Activation of the substrate differs under Ce-free conditions (B) compared to Ce-conditions (A). We propose that dicarbonyl substrates bind LiTFA, forming a PCETcompetent substrate•LiTFA complex VII. This cvomplex can undergo a MS-PCET with photoexcited 9,10-DPA*, transferring a proton to LiTFA while reducing the photocatalyst simultaneously (BDE(PhO-H) ~92 kcal/mol, 37 effective BDFE ~91 kcal/mol, see SI). The remaining steps to complete the multicatalytic cycle operate identically to the cycles described for condition A.",

Correspondingly, the gaseous carbon species CO, CO2, CH4 and C2H4 are identified as key components.",
  "(1,7)tBuCzpPhTrz was 475 nm, which was blue-shifted compared to the device using DPEPO (490 nm), but is close to the lPL (467 nm in 1:1 mCP:PPT). These results point to a reduced propensity to aggregate in the co-host system compared to DPEPO for the vacuum-deposited films with (1,7)tBuCzpPhTrz. Indeed, aggregates were found to contribute to a red-shifting of the emission of (1,7)tBuCzpPhTrz in the 1:1 mCP:PPT co-host only at higher doping concentrations (Figure ). The CIE coordinates for the device with (1,4)tBuCzpPhTrz were (0.19, 0.38) while those for the device with (1,7)tBuCzpPhTrz were (0.16, 0.27) (Figure ).",
  "Initially, a screen of different Ni sources was undertaken under our standard conditions, which for the purpose of this report shall mean reaction of aryl halide (0.7 mmol), a Ni source (0.07 mmol), KOtBu (1.4 mmol) and benzene (5 mL) at 130 o C for 16h in a 25 mL pressure tube under a N2 atmosphere, unless otherwise stated. As expected, in the absence of a Ni source, the coupled products from 1a and 1b were obtained in low yields (13 % and 15%, Table , entries 1-2) which, under these conditions, is proposed to arise via a benzyne-initiated BHAS mechanism. The addition of Ni(OAc)2 provided only marginally improved yields in coupled products obtained from 1a and 1b (15% and 20%, entries 3-4). Ni(acac)2 (acac = 2,4-pentanedionate), Ni(PPh3)4 and Ni(COD)2 (COD = 1,5-cyclooctadiene) facilitated coupling in good yields (63% -69%, entries 5-10). Recently, the Engle lab reported that bench-stable 18-electron complex Ni(COD)(DQ) (DQ = duroquinone) serves as an active pre-catalyst in a variety of Ni-mediated reactions. Inspired by the simple synthesis and remarkable stability of this complex, it was employed in our system.

The terrace diffusion mechanisms of Cu3Ox was evaluated in Figs. , which are pivotal for the growth of T-Cu2O via subsequent coalescence when followed by coalescence. This process is formed by two energetically favorable unstrained Cu3O4 states (ΔEads = +0 eV, Fig. and) and a less favorable strained state (ΔEads = +0.30 eV, Fig. ). Secondly, a two-step mechanism, involves less restricted ligand hopping events (IS1 → IS2, Ediff(2,1) = +0.32 eV; IS2 → IS3, Ediff(2,2) = +0.38 eV), suggesting a kinetically favored process, although alternating hopping events must occur in sequence for maintaining the geometric feasibility of the two-step diffusion process .",

  "To test, if the mono-and multi-valent SAv-coupled compounds would also protect from a spreading infection in primary viral target cells, we infected activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from three human donors in the presence and absence of the compounds. Infectious virus production was determined by infection of TZM-bl indicator cells with PBMC culture supernatants obtained at different days post-infection (dpi). Predictably, AMD3100, a clinically approved CXCR4 antagonist , blocked X4-tropic HIV-1, while Maraviroc (MVC), a CCR5-antagonist, fully prevented R5-tropic HIV-1 replication. SAv-VIR-102C9, SAv-EPI-X4 JM#173-C, and SAv-VIR-102C9-EPI-X4 JM#173-C all significantly reduced the replication of X4-tropic HIV-1. SAv-VIR-109C2 reduced the replication of R5-tropic HIV-1 albeit less efficiently than MVC (Figure ). Altogether, the coupled peptides maintained their specific antiviral activity.",
  "The relative stereochemical assignments for ischnocybine A-C and ischnocybinone was accomplished using a combination of NMR data and theoretical calculations. Comparing experimental C NMR data for each metabolite to theoretically calculated shifts revealed the potential diastereomers-four for 9 and 10, eight for 11, and sixteen isomers for 12. Due to the numerous potential isomers for 12, carbon chemical shift and 2D ROESY data reduced the possible diastereomers from sixteen to five. A key NOESY correlation established a syn geometry between H-3 (δH 2.26) and H-9 (δH 2.03) (Figure ); based on literature reports, C-8 chemical shift (δC 36.1) agrees with a cis-fused decahydroisoquinoline system. Comparing predicted Boltzmann-weighted, DFT-calculated chemical shifts for each isomer to the experimental data, using the DP4 platform in Spartan20, allowed for the assignment of the relative configuration of each metabolites-4S,8S,9R-9 (Table ; 73.5% probability), 4R,8S,9R-10 (Table ; 99.7% probability), 4S,6S,8R,9S-11 (Table ; 86.3% probability), and 3R,4S,6S,8R,9R-12 (Table ; 78.7% probability). The lack of ROESY/NOESY correlations between any of the stereocenters 9-11 further supported these assignments. Computational analyses predicted >3.8 Å (Table ) as averaged distances between each pair of stereogenic protons in the energy optimized conformers for all diastereomers. Correlations between these protons would be weak and possibly unobserved.",

Ethyl acetate (EtOAc), 2-Methyltetrahydrofurane (2-MeTHF), Anisole, Dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and N-Formylmorpholine (NFM) were chosen as partners for both DMSO and MeCN. The selected cosolvents have different structural features (ether, ester, carbonate, amide, etc.) and differ in their hydrophobic surface area, which is important for the Van der Waals interactions.",
  "Cultivation of Xanthobacter autotrophicus. X. autotrophicus (ATCC 35674 TM ) was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The growth protocols follow the reported procedures. Briefly, the X. autotrophicus was initially inoculated on the autoclaved super nutrient broth agar plate. The super nutrient broth medium was prepared with 5 g/L nutrient broth, 4 g/L yeast extract, 3 g/L NaCl, 5 g/L sodium succinate, and 15 g/L agar for plates only. Then, an individual colony was picked from the agar plate and inoculated into the super nutrient broth solution for overnight growth at 30 ℃ with 200 rpm stirring. The pH of the culture was then adjusted to 10 ~ 11 by adding drops of 2 M NaOH. The microbial pellet was collected by centrifugation (4,830 × g, 5 min), followed by resuspending in an autoclaved inorganic minimal medium, which contains 1 g/L K2HPO4, 0.5 g/L KH2PO4, 2 g/L NaHCO3, 0.1 g/L MgSO4⋅7H2O, 0.0316 g/L CaSO4, 0.0115 g/L FeSO4⋅7H2O, and 1 ml/L trace mineral mix.

  "The activity of [BS-Fe-bTAML] -• hCAII TS was evaluated for the hydroxylation of the ethylbenzene derivative 1. Gratifyingly, the activity of [BS-Fe-bTAML] -• hCAII TS was significantly improved compared to both the free cofactor and the wild-type ArHase (two fold for the free cofactor and 1.8 fold for [BS-Fe-bTAML] -• hCAII WT , Table , entry 3). Such activity enhancement was not observed with the previously-reported biotinylated-[Fe-TAML] • streptavidin system. The affinity of [BS-Fe-bTAML] -for hCAII TS was comparable to hCAII WT (52 ± 8 nM, Table , Figure ). Differential scanning fluorimetry confirmed that the melting temperature of hCAII TS increased by 14 ºC compared to hCAII WT (i.e. 71 ºC and 57 ºC, Figure ). Accordingly, we selected hCAII TS for the remainder of this study. Next, we investigated whether the hydroxylation proceeds in cell lysates using E. coli BL21(DE3) cells harboring a plasmid encoding hCAII TS . Gratifyingly, upon cell lysis and thermal treatment at 55 ºC for 30 minutes, followed by addition of [BS-Fe-bTAML] -, the ethylbenzene derivative 1 (2500 equiv. vs. [BS-Fe-bTAML] -) and H2O2 (5000 equiv. vs. [BS-Fe-bTAML] -), we were delighted to detect the alcohol 2 and the ketone 3, albeit in significantly lower yield compared to the purified ArHase (17 vs. 2140 TTON, Figure ). Upon increasing the number of equivalents of H2O2 (50,000 equiv. vs. [BS-Fe-bTAML] -), yields (1929 TTON) comparable to those of the purified ArHase were obtained. We surmise that the background activity resulting from catalysis with the free cofactor in the empty plasmid cell-lysates (1020 TTON, corresponding to ca. 53% of the TTON for ethylbenzene 1) should remain constant during the directed evolution campaign, thus enabling to detect improved ArHase activity resulting from [BS-Fe-bTAML] -• hCAII TS mutants. Accordingly, we set out to evolve the ArHase performance using heat-treated E. coli cell lysates.",

  "Methods for characterization of the supramolecular assemblies: Fourier-Transform Infrared (FT-IR) analyses: FT-IR measurements were performed on a Nicolet iS10 spectrometer. Spectra of solutions in toluene were measured in 0.02 cm pathlength CaF2 cells at 293 K and were corrected for air, toluene and cell absorption (Figures and). Procedure for simulated FT-IR spectra (see Figures and S2 for the results), the influence of the stack ends is neglected in all cases: Threecomponent mixture composed of BTA P•[Cu], BTA (S)-Cha (0.58 mM, fs 0 = 4.5%) and BTA C8 (Figure ): The concentration of dimers of BTA (S)-Cha is presumed to be similar to that previously determined for the S&S-type coassemblies without BTA C8, i.e. mixture without achiral additive, since both mixtures show similar FT-IR traces in the 1720-1750 cm -1 region, region in which remaining BTA (S)-Cha dimers can be detected and quantified (Figure ). The amount of BTA (S)-Cha monomers in dimers and stacks is thus estimated to be 0.18±0.13 mM and 0.40±0.13 mM, respectively, that corresponds to 30±20% and 70±20% of BTA (S)-Cha introduced in the solution (the high uncertainty is due to the low intensity of the signals). The simulated spectrum is built by summing the FT-IR spectra of these remaining BTA (S)-Cha dimers (0.18 mM), of BTA P•[Cu] (BTA P 5.8 mM + [Cu(OAc)2•H2O] 1.45 mM), BTA C8 (5.8 mM) and of BTA Met (0.40 mM, in methylcyclohexane, used as blueprint of BTA (S)-Cha monomers in stacks). Three-component mixture composed of BTA P•[Cu], BTA (S)-Cha (0.030 mM, fs 0 = 0.25%) and BTA C8 (Figure ): The amount of BTA (S)-Cha is too low to detect the corresponding signals. The simulated spectrum is built by summing the FT-IR spectra of BTA P•[Cu] (BTA P 5.8 mM + [Cu(OAc)2•H2O] 1.45 mM), of BTA C8 (5.8 mM) and of BTA Met (0.030 mM, in methylcyclohexane, used as blueprint of BTA (S)-Cha monomers in stacks). Three-component mixture composed of BTA P•[Cu], BTA (S)-Cha (0.58 mM, fs 0 = 4.5%) and BTA Achc (Figure ): The concentration of remaining BTA (S)-Cha dimers cannot be determined precisely because both BTA (S)-Cha (0.58 mM) and BTA Achc (5.8 mM) absorb in the 1720-1750 cm -1 region. Simulations for both no (i.e. segregation) and full coassembly can be made in that case since BTA (S)-Cha and BTA Achc form dimers and small aggregates on their own, respectively. The simulated spectrum for segregation of the three partners in their own assemblies is built by summing their individual FT-IR spectra, BTA (S)-Cha (0.58 mM), BTA P•[Cu] (BTA P 5.8 mM + [Cu(OAc)2•H2O] 1.45 mM) and BTA Achc (5.8 mM). The simulated spectrum for full coassembly is built by summing the FT-IR spectra of BTA P•[Cu] (BTA P 5.8 mM + [Cu(OAc)2•H2O] 1.45 mM) of BTA Met (0.58 mM, in methylcyclohexane, used as blueprint of BTA (S)-Cha monomers in stacks) and of BTA Aib (5.8 mM, in methylcyclohexane, used as blueprint of BTA Achc monomers in stacks). Three-component mixture composed of BTA P•[Cu], BTA (S)-Cha (0.030 mM, fs 0 = 0.25%) and BTA Achc (Figure ): The simulated spectrum for segregation of the three partners in their own assemblies is built by summing their individual FT-IR spectra, BTA (S)-Cha (extrapolated to 0.030 mM), BTA P•[Cu] (BTA P 5.8 mM + [Cu(OAc)2•H2O] 1.45 mM) and BTA Achc (5.8 mM).

  "Resonance (NMR) experiments were performed on the pristine Li2NH powder as synthesized, after cycling (ex situ) and in situ during electrochemical cycling. Ex situ solid state NMR spectra on the pristine material and Li1.917NH1.083 were acquired on a 11.7 T (ωH = 500 MHz) Bruker Avance III spectrometer, while the cycled Li2NH spectra were acquired on a 16.4 T (ωH = 700 MHz) Bruker Avance III spectrometer. In both cases a Bruker 1.3 mm magic angle spinning (MAS) probe was used with a MAS frequency of 40 kHz. The spectra were externally referenced to glycine (spun at 20 kHz) at 8.00 ppm (δ 1 H) and Li2CO3 at 0.00 ppm (δ . In all cases, a rotor-synchronised Hahn-echo pulse sequence (90°-τ-180°-τ-acquire) was used for quantitative measurements. The recycle delay adopted was at least 5×T1, the T1 having been measured via a saturation recovery pulse sequence ((sat)n-τ-90°acquire). For Li NMR, pulse lengths of 1.0 μs (at 11.7 T) and 2.05 μs (at 16.4 T) and recycle delays of 1.36 s (pristine), 10 s (cycled), 2.65 s (Li1.917NH1.083) were set; for 1 H NMR, pulse lengths of 0.87 μs (at 11.7 T) and 2.15 μs (at 16.4 T) and recycle delays of 28.9 s (pristine), 23.4 s (cycled) and 26.5 s (Li1.917NH1.083) were set.

  "In addition, the novel P-amidites 31 and 32 based on the 4-(hydroxymethyl)phenol-core were developed to enable further orthogonal deprotection conditions. TIPS-containing O-alcohol 19 was transformed to silyl-protected 18 O2-P-amidite 31 in 65% yield. Its deprotection mechanism (scheme 3, C) includes TBAFinduced TIPS-removal triggering 5-ring lactonization and fragmentation towards unprotected 18 O-phosphates. O2-BigFM-P-amidite 32 was synthesized from O-BigFM-alcohol 20 in 65% yield. The deprotection mechanism of 32 (scheme 3, C) is based on a DBU-induced self-immolation cascade of Fmoc-elimination, 6-ring lactamization and fragmentation, liberating Ophosphates. Finally, the DNA precursor O-AB-DMT-thymine-P-amidite 33 was accessed in 66% yield from O-AB-alcohol 17 and the corresponding P-diamidite. P-amidite 33 is fully compatible with automated solid-phase DNA-synthesis, as the AB-group is removed under comparable conditions required for β-CE-group cleavage.

  "The structures of key dimetalloalkene intermediates 2 and 5 are unambiguously determined by X-ray crystallography (Figure ). A dimagnesioalkene for XRD analysis was synthesized by a reaction of 1a with mineral oil-free sodium lumps in the presence of isopropylmagnesium chloride for a long reaction time of 16 h. After removal of NaCl, recrystallization from toluene provided the corresponding trans-1,2-dimagnesioethene 2a iPr (thf)4 as yellowish orange crystals in 47% yield. According to a similar procedure, trans-1,2-dialuminoethene 5a Et (thf)2 was prepared from diethylaluminium chloride as pale yellow crystals in 12% yield. The verification of the trans stereochemistry of 5 is important to eliminate the possibility of the preferential formation of its cis isomer. X-ray diffraction study on singles crystals of both 2a iPr (thf)4 and 5a Et (thf)2 displayed dimetallic structures where the two metals occupy the trans-positions to each other in the central ethene skeletons. The C1-C1' bonds in the [PhCCPh] unit delivered from diphenylacetylene are elongated to typical C=C double bonds (1.328(6) Å for 2a iPr (thf)4 and 1.355(2) Å for 5a Et (thf)2) along with formation of comparable C(sp 2 )-metal bonds (C1-Mg in 2a iPr : 2.195(4) Å, and C1-Al in 5a Et : 2.005(2) Å) with those in the reported 1,2dimagnesioethene 14 and 1,2-dialuminoethenes. Having the isolated 1,2-dimetalloethenes 2a iPr (thf)4 and 5a Et (thf)2 in hand, we resorted to demonstrating reactivity similar to that described in Figure and 3b. 1,2-Dimagnesioethene 2a iPr (thf)4 underwent the copper-catalyzed hydroxyalkylation using isobutylene oxide to afford 4ab in 80% yield (Figure ). 1,2-Dialuminoethene 5a Et (thf)2 reacted with paraformaldehyde to provide 6a in 80% yield (Figure ).

In order to investigate the mechanism of the unique dearomatization of arylacetylenes (Figure and 3b), we carried out DFT calculation using the reaction of 1,2-dialumino-1,2-diphenylethene 5a Me with monomeric formaldehyde in THF solvent as a model reaction (Figure ).",
  "Control experiments indicate that the aniline additives facilitate formation of the a,a-difluorinated thioether product (21, Figure ), which contrasts previously reported conditions for defluorinative thiolation that utilized K2CO3 as an additive (Figure ). As a control, the reaction of gem-difluorostyrene 1 with octane-1-thiol proceeds in 45% yield and 19:1 selectivity in the absence of an additive (entry 1), while the addition of 10% p-aminoacetophenone increases the yield to 68% and selectivity beyond 25:1 (entry 2). In contrast, addition of K2CO3 (2.0 equiv.) increases the yield of undesired a-fluorovinylthioether 25 and decreases the selectivity of the reaction to 2:1 (entry 3), while the addition of both p-aminoacetophenone and K2CO3 provides C. 23 (Linear:Branched) >95% (>20:1)",
  "Once formed (either in pathways 1, 2 or 3), the i3 intermediate can isomerize to i4 (located 454 kJ/mol below the energy of the reactants), a 7-membered ring species with two nitrogen atoms in the ring (see Figure ). The associated transition state, T4, (+10 kJ/mol with respect to i3) clearly shows the breaking of a C-C bond that allows the N atom to \"slide\" into the ring. In turn, the i4 intermediate can directly dissociate to the products of channel (11), one of the H-displacement mechanisms. The calculated enthalpy change of channel (11) is -129 kJ/mol. Alternatively, i4 can follow the path T5 → i30 → T7 → i7→ T13, leading to the products pyrrolyl radical (C4H4N) + hydrogen cyanide (HCN) (channel (1)). Additionally, a different isomerization path, T6 → i8 → T9→ i9→ T12, is responsible for the formation of the 1H-imidazolyl radical and acetylene (channel (3)). The global reaction enthalpy of the two product channels (1) and (3) are -427 kJ/mol and -297 kJ/mol, respectively, at the B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory.",
  "In conclusion, we demonstrated the synthesis of three new RhMOPs covalently grafted with photodimerizable coumarin side chains (C10-Coumarin-RhMOP, C3-Coumarin-RhMOP, and 12:12 C10-Coumarin/OH-RhMOP), as verified by NMR, UV-Vis spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry experiments. Irradiation of low-concentration RhMOP solutions at 350 nm triggered the intramolecular dimerization of their coumarin side chains, with C10-Coumarin-RhMOP exhibiting the highest dimerization quantum yield due to the high density and conformational flexibility of the coumarin chains. Irradiation of high-concentration C10-Coumarin-RhMOP solutions enabled their direct polymerization into dense thin films connected entirely through cyclobutane crosslinks. In contrast, coordination-driven polymerization of C10-Coumarin-RhMOP into a colloidal gel, followed by site-selectively irradiation, afforded dual coordination/covalent RhMOP gels, which exhibited equivalent porosity and greater mechanical strength compared to their solely coordination-linked counterparts. Dissociation of coordination crosslinkers from the doubly crosslinked networks afforded solely covalent Coumarin-RhMOP gels, which are among the most readily deformable and chemically robust MOP gels reported to date, with structures and mechanical properties can be reversibly tuned through the coordination of their open rhodium sites with Lewis bases. These findings establish coumarin-mediated photopolymerization as a powerful method for assembling mechanically tunable, structurally diverse porous materials from solution-processible molecular pores, and open up new opportunities to incorporate complex functionality into this emergent class of amorphous porous networks. chromen-7-yl)oxy)decyl)oxy)isophthalic acid; C10-Coumarin-RhMOP, cuboctahedral Rh(II) paddlewheel MOP prepared from Rh(OAc)4(MeOH)2 and C10-Coumarin-bdcH2; 12:12 C10-Coumarin/OH-RhMOP, statistical distribution of cuboctahedral Rh(II) paddlewheel MOPs prepared from Rh(OAc)4(MeOH)2 and a 1:1 mixture of 5-hydroxyisopthalic acid and C10-Coumarin-bdcH2; diz, 1-dodecylimidazole.",

The 1 H NMR yielded a sharp and discrete major species, in contrast to the mixture of cage isomers observed in the self-assembly of 3 (Figure ). DOSY showed a single diffusion band, indicating formation of a single species with a hydrodynamic radius of 28.3 Å (Figure ). ESI-HRMS confirmed successful self-assembly of a Pd3L4 cage 10, with 10(BF4) and 10(BF4)2 4+ peaks dominant, and isotopic distributions matching simulations (Figure , S85 -S87).

  "The key intermediate on the way to O-P-amidites is O-4-(hydroxymethyl)phenol (16, scheme 2). Its synthesis commenced from 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (14) by acetalization in 50% yield on multi-gram scale. To ensure the required purity (>99%) of acetal 11, we developed a crystallization procedure from cyclohexane/ethylacetate. Other acetalization conditions were unsuccessful, as P-donor substituted benzacetals are highly prone to hydrolysis. Scheme 2: Syntheses of functionalized O-(hydroxymethyl)phenols from 4hydroxybenzaldehyde (16). The high tendency of acetal 11 to hydrolyse was subsequently exploited by melting a mixture of 11 and H2 18 O (2.5 eq., > 99% isotopic purity). O-Labelled aldehyde 15 was unstable towards humidity induced H2 O back-exchange, resulting in loss of labelling efficiency. To overcome this issue, 15 was directly reduced with dry NaBH4 in triethylene glycol dimethyl ether to access key building-block O-(hydroxymethyl)phenol 16 in 86% yield over 2 steps, and with an isotopic purity of >99% on a multi gram-scale.

  ", where l is the number of ligands. ℎ % is one-hot embedding to encode the coordination site, ℎ % =3ℎ % ! , … , ℎ % \" 4 ∈ ℝ '×& . ℎ $ and ℎ % are concatenated together as ℎ $% for simplicity. A scaled ratio of [0.1, 0.25, 1] is applied to 𝑥 = [𝑟, ℎ # , ℎ $% ] to highlight the importance of ℎ $% , which is pivotal in ligand generation, as illustrated below. The noise is only relevant to 𝑟 and ℎ # , i.e., in the diffusion process, the sampled noise is added to 𝑟 and ℎ # from the diffused ligands and in the denoising step, randomly generated noise is used to represent 𝑟 and ℎ # for the generated ligands while ℎ $% is already predefined before denoising.",
  "In the small molecule CRN (Figure ), amine substrates t-Am-1 or t-Am-2 react with DVP to generate an intermediary allylammonium ion (DVP-t-Am-1 or DVP-t-Am-2). After fuel activation, reaction with a thiol (SH-3) forms a waste product (DVP-S) and regenerates the amine substrate, thus completing one cycle. Using sub-stoichiometric amounts of amine (0.2 eq.) with excess fuel (1.0 eq.) we first converted t-Am-1 and t-Am-2 to the activated intermediates (0.2 eq.), which upon SH-3 addition (0.2 eq.) reversed back to the neutral amine."
