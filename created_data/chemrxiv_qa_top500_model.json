    "question": "What specific structural features enhance the binding efficiency of the molecule?",

Indeed, when considering protein dynamics it enabled to cover Side and Diag1 dynamic distances and even marginally some Diag2 chelation binding mode. This unique combination of chelation and statistical-rebinding with the capacity to adapt to the structural plasticity of the receptor is the secret of the net boost in avidity.",
